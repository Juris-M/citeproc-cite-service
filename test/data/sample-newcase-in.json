Two teams of expert witnesses (2 psychologists and 2 psychiatrists) provided opinions concerning whether the trauma suffered resulted from woman's experience in Pakistan or from her stay in detention. While the court recognized the first was more significant, it emphasized the stress suffered by the two children in detention, especially with regard to the 8-year daughter, who was \"particularly prone to negative experiences resulting from he stay at the center along people representing dramatically different cultures and customs\".\n\n# Comments by the judge on cultural expertise\n\nThe court discussed the experts' ability to  distinguish between trauma suffered in Pakistan and trauma suffered in detention.\n\n# General Comments\n\nThe decision was overturned by Supreme Court, see decision II KK 358/16, sent back for re-examination.",
