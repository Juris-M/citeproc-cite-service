`make-data` CSVâ†’CSL-JSON conversion script
==========================================

Introduction
------------

The workflow for adding records to the CULTEXP database involves three steps for each jurisdiction:

1.  Preparation of a spreadsheet with entries for each document or case to be added to the database;
2.  Generation of a well-structured CSL-JSON file for Jurism/Zotero import based on the spreadsheet entries;
3.  Import of the CSL-JSON data into a Jurism client, and syncing of the data to the `zotero.org` cloud server;
4.  Pulling of data to the CULTEXP front-end server via the `zotero.org` API.

Steps (2) and (3) are explained below. [1]
