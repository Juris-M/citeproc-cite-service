When they had registered the birth of their daughter before the Public Registry a few years earlier, they were told that their daughter must be registered with the father's surname as the established common practice in Malta. The parents however opened a case claiming that they want to rectify an error made by the Director on the birth certificate of their daughter because in Russia, surnames of females are customarily added an ""-a"" at the end to reflect their gender as females. Several family members as well as the Russian Ambassador were asked to testify to this cultural practice claiming that it was in the best interest of the child to have her surname reflect her female gender. The court concluded that the fact that the daughter was given the surname of the father by the Public Registry did not amount to an error. Nonetheless it accepted the arguments made in favour of amending the minor's surname to follow Russian custom and ordered all official documents to reflect this change.",Maltese,

It successfully made a warrant of prohibitory injunction to stop the plaintiffs, a group of beer manufacturers, from organising an event during the same period by the name of Oktoberfest. The defendant company claimed that it had been using the word for longer and that using the same word would confuse the general public. The plaintiffs initiated a court action claiming that Oktoberfest, a term associated with the German culture and event of beer-drinking, cannot be monopolised. The court entered into a discussion on trademarks. It argued that it is accepted by the relevant jurisprudence that although common words in general vocabulary cannot be monopolised by anyone, if a word, including a common one, has acquired an indication of the quality of the goods as well as their origin, and is known as such in the local trade, then no other trader may use that word. Nonetheless, the court decided that in this case the term Oktoberfest is internationally known and linked to beer-drinking German culture and that in the local market it did not acquire any secondary meaning to deserve any special protection. Therefore, all parties could use the term to advertise their event.",Maltese,

They claimed that the uncle of the child who had registered the birth of the newborn at the Public Registry had misunderstood the name and the uncle confirmed this account. Moreover, the parents argued that leaving the child with what they now learnt is a boy's name will prejudice their daughter. The parents also claimed that in Muslim countries it is culturally normal for the children to also have the father's name as part of their full name and that they therefore expected that this would be the case in Malta too. The court accepted that through the evidence brought forward by the claimants, the daughter was already known by the names that the parents wished to give her and therefore, without entering further into detail on the cultural naming trends in the parent’s country of origin, the court concluded that all official documents shall be amended to reflect the name that the daughter is already known by.",Maltese,

The applicant then filed a subsequent application on the basis of new findings including a report by a cultural expert. The applicant claims to have an actual and well-founded fear of persecution should she be returned to her country of origin, Sudan. She fears arrest, imprisonment and torture should she be returned on the basis of her actual and imputed political opinion. Moreover, she also fears that female genital mutilation (FGM) would be inflicted on her daughter. An arrest warrant had been issued in her name and her husband had been detained and injured for some months in order for him to disclose her whereabouts. The applicant claims that she is an active part of the leadership of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement -North (SPLM-N), of which she has been a member since 2005; at a time when the party was known as the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM). The cultural expert writes a report about his interview with the applicant and discuses SPLM-N; an active political party and opposition movement whose main aim is to fight for freedom, equality, female liberation, and against discrimination, especially discrimination based on religious identity. He agrees that following the revolution in Sudan, it is still in a state of revolt against the Government. The expert corroborates the applicant's version of events and assesses her credibility.

The absent wife on the other hand, who had left Malta altogether and was living in Thailand, was represented throughout the proceedings by a lawyer and a legal procurator who acted as her curator. The husband also requested restitution of the dowry paid to the defendant’s parents, the paraphernal property and all court expenses by the defendant. In his note of submissions, the defendant’s lawyer claimed that despite various attempts to reach her, he was unable to communicate with her. The plaintiff argued that the dowry included a sum of €12,110.01 demanded by the wife’s parents, as per supposed Thai tradition. The plaintiff claimed that although this had created friction between them, he paid the requested sum because had read online that it would be returned to the couple after marriage. The plaintiff demanded the restitution of the portion of the dowry that was not used to cover the couples’ wedding expenses. The husband also requested the acquisition of the car which he bought during the marriage and thus formed part of the community of acquests but which he had paid alone for in its entirety. In its judgement the court seconded the plaintiff’s requests to attribute the causes for the marriage dissolution entirely on the defendant and to award him the car bought during the marriage as his property. However, the court refused to husband’s request in relation to the dowry arguing that the dowry as per Thai culture was given by the husband to the wife’s parents, whilst the proceeding had been lodged by the husband against the wife only.",Maltese,

The couple married after knowing each other for three months. Although both being Christian Orthodox, they agreed to celebrate a civil marriage only. The husband claimed that his wife never had the intention to have a matrimonial life with him and that therefore, his consent to the marriage is extorted by fraud. He said that only once they were married, did he learn that his wife had children in Ethiopia and that she did not wish to have more children. He admitted that they never discussed having children before marriage as it is also not common to do so in Eritrean culture and the desire for children once married is taken for granted. Additionally, the couple never consummated their marriage. The wife on the other hand claimed that in their religion, sexual relationships outside of marriage are prohibited but once they were married, she realised that their relationship was not going well and so she anyway did not wish any sexual contact. The court went into a discussion on the various grounds for annulment established at law, stating that the fact that the wife already had children, objectively, at least in the Maltese culture, is not in its nature sufficiently serious so as to disrupt matrimonial life. Nonetheless, the court added that it must be analysed from the perspective of the parties’ culture and religion and from the point of view of the party alleging deception. The court said, in the case at hand, the defendant admitted not telling her husband about her child in Ethiopia prior to the celebration of marriage because she feared repercussions. The court further added that although it was sufficiently proven that the parties did not consummate the marriage, which is a valid ground of annulment in Maltese law, the parties did not request annulment on this ground. The court nonetheless annulled the marriage concluding that it was sufficiently proven that the consent of the husband was exhorted by fraud.",Maltese,

He claimed the non-consummation was exclusively due to his wife’s will. The husband recounted how in Syrian culture it often happens that a marriage is carried out after a short period of acquaintance; sometimes only after a few days. He claimed a friend, proficient in both Arabic and Maltese, made the necessary arrangements for his wife, at the time seventeen years of age, to travel to his small village in Syria. There was a language barrier between them, but the friend acted as an interpreter. After celebrating a Syria wedding, the newlyweds went to live with the husband’s relatives consisting also of the extended family. He stressed they were not intimate. The defendant then left for Malta to prepare the necessary bureaucratic arrangements for her husband’s arrival to Malta. Upon his arrival six months later, they lived with the wife’s parents but soon sought their own accommodation. At this point, he realised that his wife had little interest in family life or house chores, went out a lot also in the company of men. In her version of events, the wife mostly confirmed the husband’s version of events, claiming she was too young when they married. The court rejected parties’ claims that the marriage was to be annulled on the ground that it was not consummated because the request for annulment was filed eight years after marriage as well as various credibility issues with both of their version of events. Nonetheless, without entering into the cultural aspect of marriages and short courtships in Syria, the court concluded that the marriage was brought about by immaturity and impulsiveness of the defendant who went to Syria after knowing someone online for three months and decided that the marriage was vitiated by a serious defect of discretion of judgement on the matrimonial life.",Maltese,

The spouses travelled from Malta to the wife’s Russian hometown to spend the Christmas period with her family. They however were robbed with damages amounting to 14,722 Euro. Of a particular value were a diamond ring and some fur. The couple had purposely bought a home insurance policy to ensure that these valuables would be covered in the case of theft. The wife had carried them in the luggage because it was deemed unsafe to move around with these objects on display. Nevertheless, the plaintiffs claimed it was necessary to travel with these items. They justified it on the basis that Russian Orthodox Christian tradition demanded that the best and most valuable clothing are worn during the Christmas celebrations. The insurance company, albeit compensating the couple for the loss of all the other personal possessions in the stolen luggage, refused to compensate the couple for these two objects of value. The court rejected the insurance company’s claims that the policy was inapplicable due to the geographical nature of their voyage and because Russia was not part of Europe concluding that Russia is a Euro-Asian country and is also a member of the Council of Europe. Moreover, the court rejected the insurance company’s claim that the policy was only in the husband’s name and that the valuables belonged to the wife because they were bought during marriage and thus pertained to both spouses. The court ordered the insurance company to compensate the plaintiffs and court expenses.",Maltese,

The incident related to the defendants’ religious village feast. The prosecutor explained that it was considered a yearly tradition for frequenters, of both the political party club and the football supporters club in close proximity of where the procession band passed, to lie on the floor in front of the moving bandsmen to grind them to a halt. The tradition, explained the police, is that the people would lay on the floor until the police intervene and physically move them out of the way. On this occasion however, the accused, some of which were relatives, ended up being arrested after being aggressive, pushing and kicking the police which resulted in a commotion. The prosecutors claimed that the accused went further than tradition by insisting on staying on the floor and disrupting the procession. The court found four out of the five accused guilty of some or all of the accusations brought against them.",Maltese,

From the evidence brought forward by the parties, the couple met in Malta, when the defendant resided at the plaintiff’s father’s house while studying. When his student visa was about to expire, the two decided to get married as they had grown fond of each other. Once married, nothing much changed as the mixed couple continued to live in the house of the plaintiff’s father, they had no offspring and kept their assets separate. The plaintiff motivated her request for annulment claiming that there were irreconcilable differences based on their differing cultures. In particular, the wife complained that she had to cook without pork, that he spent considerable sums of money to see his family in his home country and that the defendant spent considerable time at the Mosque as three of the most pressing cultural problems that arose during marriage. The defendant agreed with the request for annulment but rejected the notion that he should bear the entire costs relating to the proceedings. The Court noted that the requirements for an annulment are fulfilled if the consent of either of the parties is vitiated by a serious defect of discretion of judgment on the matrimonial life, or on its essential rights and duties. It concluded that neither of these were sufficiently proven. The court did not delve into the cultural issues brought forward by the plaintiff but concluded that the cultural problems that supposedly arose after marriage were known beforehand by the couple who had already been living together for a year prior to marrying as well as the fact that the plaintiff’s father was also married to a Muslim and thus the family had exposure to the Muslim culture and traditions. The court rejected the request for annulment and ordered that the expenses be divided equally between the parties.",Maltese,
MT011,2016.01.28,1191/2014/LSO,,,Qorti Civili Prim' Awla,Malta,https://ecourts.gov.mt/onlineservices/Judgements/Details?JudgementId=0&CaseJudgementId=98725,Peru; surname; marriage; Peruvian naming system; public Registry; birth certificates,administrative law,"The plaintiffs initiated proceedings requesting that their son’s surname be changed in the Public Registry. The issue stemmed from the fact that in Peru, the father’s country of origin, a Hispanic tradition of giving children the surnames of both parents was followed, with the paternal one preceding the maternal. However, only the paternal part of the father’s surname is passed on to the offspring and the father's second surname, which refers to the father’s maternal surname, was not passed on. The plaintiffs argued that this incongruity would cause the child problems in his frequent travels to see family members residing in Peru. The plaintiffs claimed that in Peruvian culture the father’s dual surname is only passed on to the children in its entirety when he is the sole parent. The plaintiffs also claimed that the surname of his Maltese documents created a discrepancy with what is stated in his Peruvian passport. The plaintiffs thus requested that the Maltese Public Registry alter their son’s surname so as to adhere to the Hispanic system. The Director of Public Registry argued that in 1998, when the birth of the child in question was registered, there was no opportunity to specify the offspring’s surname because the father’s surname (or in certain circumstances, the mother’s surname) was automatically given, in its entirety, without omissions or partial applications. Therefore, the registration was carried out in the correct terms according to Maltese Law. The Court confirmed the Registry’s position and said that even although it is understanding and accepting the cultural differences, the child was born in Malta and consequently the child’s registration should be carried out in conformity to Maltese Law. It added that Maltese law does not cater to foreign laws and customs and the opposite also applies. The court noted how when the couple married in Peru, the mother had herself added her maternal surname to her already present paternal one in order to conform to the laws present in the country of registration. The Court therefore refused the plaintiffs’ requests, with court expenses to be paid by the plaintiffs.",Maltese,

The first court concluded that the consent of either of the parties was vitiated by the positive exclusion of marriage itself as the defendant had married for the sole reason of obtaining residence and work permits in Malta. The couple’s version of the events varies greatly on numerous issues including the duration of the courtship and marriage, sexual interaction before and after marriage and their place of residence during that time period. The wife asserted that they had had a seven-month courtship after which they married so that he be allowed to stay in Malta and obtain a work permit. She said that after marriage she never saw him again; they never lived together or had sexual intercourse and he had gone to live with his brother. The husband on the other hand, claimed that he had married out of love and that he was regularly employed even before marriage. He claimed that for two and a half years they lived together as spouses. He also argued that short courtships are common practice in Syria and he was under the impression that the same happened in Malta. The court had found the wife’s version of events more credible, and disputed the defendant’s claim of marrying out of love after such a short courtship, further arguing that at a certain point the husband had left for three months, without his wife, to see his relatives in Syria. The first court also noted that the defendant had failed to provide evidence of their cohabitation or his pre-marriage employment, and thus granted annulment of the marriage and divided expenses between them arguing that wife bore some responsibility for showing lack of responsibility before entering into such an ill-thought marriage. The Court of Appeal confirmed this decision and noted that the appellant had provided the court with his brother’s address when he had been asked for the address of the residence in which he claims the couple had resided in. The court therefore rejected the appeal and ordered that the decision be sent to the Director of the Department of Citizenship and Expatriate Affairs.",Maltese,

The wife met her husband, who worked as a bartender, while she was studying in Malta on a student visa and the two got married after a nine-month courtship. After a year together, the wife, a Muslim, stopped taking the contraceptive pill in order to have children. The husband, however, started taking own precautions as he did not want to have any children. Moreover, she wanted to bring the children up in Islamic faith while the defendant opposed to the idea of both having children and the faith to be imposed on them, as he preferred bringing them up as Catholic. The plaintiff cites other cultural differences that emerged after the nuptials including disagreements on food, days of relaxation and type of entertainment. In addition, the defendant stopped working altogether upon marriage and placed the entire financial burden on the plaintiff. The Court agreed on the annulment and ruled in favour of the plaintiff. The Court concluded the defendant incapable of assuming marriage obligations, in particular that of cohabitation between spouses aimed at reciprocal well-being of the parties and the procreation and upbringing of children. This, said the court, prevented the parties from forming between them a union based on love and life. The court further ruled that the fault was entirely of the defendant.",English,

The defendants pleaded guilty. The incident happened during the feast of the Trinity in Marsa. The Court took into consideration their early guilty pleas and the fact that they had made an apology to the police members towards which most of the offences were directed. However, the court said that an example should be made of the accused because too often these occasions had been marred by trouble. Although no expert on Maltese culture was appointed, the court went into a detailed discussion on the importance of feasts in Maltese culture. The court established that feasts are part of Maltese culture and fruit of Maltese Catholic faith, adding that it is not acceptable that religious celebrations be the ground for such condemnable behaviour. In its considerations the court went on to say that these feasts have become celebrations of paganism as opposed to honouring God’s name and the Saint that the feasts are named after. It noted that disturbances such as that in the case itself have become a common occurrence and that other incidents such as deaths at fireworks factories have further marred these religious cultural events. The court called upon the Catholic Church to intervene and take the necessary steps to ensure that families attending these events are not placed at risk. The court imposed a conditional discharged on the defendants on the condition that they do not commit any other crime within two years and encouraged them to avoid the Marsa feast for the years to come.",Maltese,

The proceedings revolved around a very high-profile case due to the particularly gruesome details surrounding the incident which saw the defendant dispose of his sick dog by placing it alive in a garbage bag and throwing it in a skip under a mountain of rubble. The dog’s cries were heard by passer-byers and the dog was rescued but it later succumbed to its injuries. The defendant argued that there were procedural errors and that the prison sentencing was influenced in part by the great public outcry generated by the story’s publication in the media. The Court of Appeals rejected most of the arguments brought forward by the appellant, reminding him of his previous conviction for animal cruelty, which made a sentence of effective prison time permissible under the law. The court made various considerations regarding the treatment of animals in the Maltese Islands. It denunciated a culture of disregard for animals’ wellbeing that in the court’s belief was ingrained in the Maltese society. The court criticized the nation’s track record in this aspect as many view animals only in light of the financial benefit or enjoyment they bring. The court quoted the Bible whereby Man was ordered to rule over all other creatures and thus is also responsible for their well-being. It went on to list a number of examples of animal mistreatment typical to the local culture such as that of traditional horse-drawn carriages left in the scorching sun without any shelter, a famous case in which a number of cats had been crucified against church doors and bird hunting. On the latter subject it argued that sport hunting is anachronistic as it serves no function except that of human enjoyment and that no enjoyment should ever be obtained through the killing of other living creatures. The court said that emotion derived from killing should have been left to our troglodyte period in history and it is inconceivable how it is still present in the culture of a modern 21st century society. Malta, it argued, should ban it outright to set an example to all of Europe. Banning should occur even if the practice is considered cultural and traditional, as often argued. If the practice in question is morally questionable, said the court, then continuance in the name of tradition reflects very poorly on the present society. The court concluded that the appellant is the result of a system and culture that glorifies humans and humans only without the least consideration on the creatures and suffering caused to them. In its judgement the Court of Appeals confirmed the prison sentence but after taking into consideration the appellant’s financial situation reduced the fine to a mandatory minimum of €4000.",Maltese,

Ahmariku is the official language but French and Italian have major roles. Ethiopian plaintiff argued that in Ethiopia name spelling during registration of birth depends greatly on the registrar’s particular social context and that the plaintiff being of French tradition, should have had his surname spelled differently. The issue became even more convoluted when the co-plaintiff and the first child of a marriage with a Maltese national was born. The birth was registered in Ethiopia and apart from being given a variation of the name James, he was also registered as different both to his father’s surname and its preferred adaptation. The plaintiffs presented numerous documentation to show that they are widely known by that surname, including one from the Ethiopian embassy in Rome which confirmed that the plaintiff’s surname pronunciation. In addition, the co-plaintiff stated that he is only known as James and recounted a moment during his school days when his classmates found out about his registered name and he was teased for it. Although that remains one of the only instances in which he remembers being referred to by the given name, he argued this discrepancy causes him inevitable issues when going through official channels. The plaintiffs therefore requested the court to change the surname and consequently that of his descendants including of his four children. The son of the co-plaintiff also requested that his first name be changed. The Registrar defended his position by saying that he only applied the law as written, that the law allows changes to names and not surnames and that his given name was registered in Malta in accordance to what is stated in his Ethiopian birth certificate. The court argued that while it is true that the law does not allow for surname changes, it should not be applied rigorous and surname changes are accepted in circumstances that merit it. The court argued that surname changes are limited by law so as to protect third parties who need to seek process against others, however discrepancies between registered names, their application in documentation and their everyday use constitute a greater hindrance to third parties. The court decided that the plaintiffs had provided enough evidence to prove that they are known by those names and ordered the Director of Public Registry to accede to the plaintiffs’ demands by carrying out the changes requested. The court however did defend the defendant’s actions to be motivated entirely by the written law and thus ordered all expenses to be paid by the plaintiffs.",Maltese,

The accused did not contest the charges but instead argued that the Khat plant is widely used in Somalian culture. The accused argued that in Somalian culture Khat is often chewed, but he wanted to put it in soup. The court concluded that foreign customs and ignorance of Malta’s Drug Laws are no justification, and found the defendant guilty of the charges brought forward, condemning him to six months imprisonment, a fine and payment of court fees. The defendant appealed the sentence on the basis that he had imported the Khat plant which was not specifically banned by Maltese law. Maltese law, he argued, only restricted its derivatives cathinone and cathine. For purposes of explanation, the appellant argued that an important distinction can be made between the Khat plan and other drug plants such as the cannabis plant, the coca plant and opium poppy, as in the latter cases the plants themselves were also banned.",English,

At this point, upon his lawyer’s request, the Court ordered the defendant to undergo a psychiatric evaluation which found him to be mentally unstable, psychotic and unable to understand his criminal responsibility and the ongoing proceedings. The court-appointed psychiatrist said that the young Somali had a history of mental illness and a poor medication adherence which caused him to relapse. Upon hearing this testimony, the Court ordered the Defendant to be hospitalized in order to receive the attention and medication necessary and to resume proceedings only when it is determined that the accused is in a position to comprehend what was being said in Court. The proceedings resumed nineteen months later when the physiatrist at the mental institution where the defendant was being held testified that when she had first met him, he had been in clearly unstable state but that he had made a turn for the better within a few months. She added that the accused suffered from a schizoaffective disorder which made him lose insight, the ability to understand the importance of taking his medications, and that he probably was in the same mental state at the time of the alleged crimes. However, once released he relapsed because in the community he had failed to understand the importance of taking his medications. At this point the psychiatrist professed her suspicions that the defendant also had a limited intellectual ability which is generally determined by an IQ test but which in this case was not possible as the defendant came from a different culture and spoke a different language and therefore applying the normal methodology would not provide reliable results. She recommended that the accused be allowed to live in the community but only if monitored regularly, assisted with life-long care and supported through community-living initiatives. Taking both psychiatric evaluations in consideration the Court found the defendant to have been mentally unstable when the alleged crimes were committed and therefore declared him exempt of all criminal responsibility. It ordered him to be kept under observation at a mental institution and only released after three specialists conclude that he is ready to live in the community.",Maltese,

Both parents had remarried and created separate families since their child’s birth. The plaintiff argued in favour of a greater financial contribution and shorter visiting times by providing various examples to show that the defendant was inadequate in his parental role. She stated that he had once taken their child to the Maltese National Regatta, a traditional rowing event in which Senglea, the defendant’s village of residence famously participates in and in which the child had witnessed a brawl that broke out in the crowd. In addition, she objected to the Court’s decision to allow longer visiting hours during Senglea’s village feast dedicated to the Nativity of the Virgin Mary (Marija Bambina) claiming that the defendant would be inebriated during these festivities and he would therefore be unable to take care of the child, while at the same time exposing him to an environment of excesses. The Court rejected both claims stating that both examples represented aspects of Maltese tradition and culture and it is no fault of the defendant if a fight broke out, while noting that mother had failed to provide evidence to support her insinuations. The court noted that exposure to the village feast can do the child good especially considering that the defendant father is the Mayor of the locality. The Court took the opportunity to encourage the plaintiff appellant to accept the defendant’s active role in the upbringing of their child and that the son they share can only stand to benefit from having contact with both parents and their extended families. In this regard the Court dismissed the mother’s claim that the father did not have time for the child and would end up leaving him with the defendant’s mother concluding that grandparents are integral and important members of society and time spent with them has a beneficial effect on the grandchildren. The Court of Appeals accepted the appellant claims to maintain care and custody of the child but refuted her demands regarding visiting hours and financial support, ordering one-fifth of the court expenses to be borne by the father and the rest by the appellant mother.",Maltese,

The couple had married two years after making acquaintance, during which period the defendant regularly travelled to his home country for work reasons, for periods that ranged between two weeks and three months. Prior to marrying the plaintiff had asked him if he intended on living in Malta or Egypt and he had said that it all depended on the work he found, but this did not dissuade her from accepting his marriage proposal and she fell pregnant within one month of the civil marriage. The defendant recounts that problems started emerging after two years when she started noticing that he was hiding his business dealings from her and never let her in on his income. The couple had another child and at one point the four members of the family had gone to live with his parents in Egypt for a period of three months after which the plaintiff and the children returned to Malta, leaving the defendant husband in Egypt who then spent a further three months in his country of origin. Around this time the plaintiff requested separation to which the defendant did not agree to and he threatened to leave Malta for good while taking the children with him. The defendant describes numerous arguments they had including the religion to which their children should adhere to which started when the mother started taking her children to church, while the father wanted them to be Muslim. At one point the defendant had told her “talaq, talaq, talaq”, a method of divorce in Islam. He then left for Egypt and only made contact with his family four months later. After a year and a half not seeing the family in person, the defendant called his family to invite them to Egypt. Upon arrival, he told her that he had remarried and that he wished that they would all cohabit. The plaintiff found the situation unbearable and after a month left for Malta, never hearing from her husband again. The court accepted the plaintiff’s claims that the marriage is null and argued that the plaintiff’s infatuation for the defendant led her to accept every situation without foreseeing the evident problems that would arise. Moreover, the court argued that the defendant’s views of marriage differed both culturally and in belief to those in Malta which bases itself on the indissolubility of marriage. To support this, the court mentioned the Muslim method the defendant used to divorce his wife and which holds no legal basis in Malta as well as the fact that he married another woman and wished a polygamous marriage. The Court concluded that this meant that the defendant excluded an essential element of matrimonial life of being monogamous.",Maltese,

The police had taken criminal action when two Maltese citizens of Arab origin had filed a complaint with focus on a particular section of the published article, which had been highlighted by means of a box. The section read; “The typical Jew is clever, quick, perceptive, industrious, able in all economic and financial affairs, in short – successful. On the flipside, the typical Arab is lazy and confined to religious idiosyncrasies, with violence and intolerance at the hub of his culture. Arabs loathe the Israelis in very much the same manner they harbour anti-American sentiments. They are the embodiment of all they would have liked to be.” The court handed down a symbolic fine of 10 Maltese lira (€23.29). The appellants argued that the first court refused to hear their evidence and their request for the proceedings to be held in the civil and not criminal court. They argued the article they wrote was protected by their right of free speech. The Court of Appeal concluded that as a Court of Appeal it was not competent to deciding on whether the court of first instance should have been civil or criminal. The court then delved into the meaning and importance of free speech and liberty of expression in a democratic society and should therefore only be limited to what is strictly necessary to safeguard other values and rights such as the right to protect one’s name from defamation and the right not to be insulted or exposed to contempt based on race, belief and nationality or ethnicity. The court noted how in 2003 racism was regaining foothold in many countries, making these countermeasures and laws necessary. The law the defendants were found in breach of did not require intent on behalf of the author or publisher, but simply rested on the fact whether the reader’s consideration of a person or group of persons might be affected after reading the publication. The court stressed that it was important to read the entirety of the article, which dealt on the endemic frictions between Jews and Palestinians, and to put the cited part in the proper context. The court stated that an ordinary reader immediately realised that the author was putting forward her opinion and not an incontrovertible truth. The article therefore did not cause the reader to have less consideration of Arabs but rather made him or her take the article for what it was; that is, a personal opinion on a very complex topic, influenced by the authors biases, who had a very superficial understanding of Islamic culture. The court therefore accepted the appellants’ request to revoke the previous sentence.",Maltese,

Both substances are psychoactive alkaloids and naturally occurring in the plant, although inadequate storage within 48 hours of harvest does not yield cathinone. The appellant had bought the plant legally in the UK and travelled with it to share with other Somali friends residing in Malta, as part of his birthday celebrations. The defendant explained that the plant is commonly chewed in Somalia. The criminal court had considered the cultural relevance of the Khat plant having been used since antiquity as a recreational and religious drug by natives of Eastern Africa, the Arabian Peninsula and throughout the Middle East. The court however also noted how the plant is banned in numerous European countries; in the UK its alkaloid derivates are restricted while the plant itself is not. In its considerations, the first court refuted the defendant’s justifications saying that the ever-growing influx of migrants does not mean the acceptance of extraneous traditions, especially ones with serious illegal implications and that the accused, although ignorant of the substance containing cathinone and cathine, was aware of the stimulant effects through its mastication. The defendant was sentenced six months imprisonment and fined. The appeal revolved primarily around the legal status of the plant which is not in itself restricted but only substances derived from it. The court found issue with the fact that the first court had found the appellant guilty of importation and possession of cathinone since, due to improper storage, none had been found. However, more importantly, the Court of Appeals refuted the idea that sole possession of a plant, not specifically banned by law and from which controlled substances can be obtained, constituted in itself a crime. It said that this position would open a pandora’s box rendering people liable for possessing certain plants simply because they contain, alone or in combination, a prohibited drug or substance. The only exception to this, said the court, would occur if it were to be proven that the accused obtained the plant specifically to be in possession or traffic the drug naturally occurring in the plant. This however had not been proven by the prosecution. In view of this, the court acquitted the appellant of all charges brought against him.",English,

The plaintiff argued that -- is the patronymic name, meaning that it refers to him as being the “son of --” and therefore it is not to be considered part of his name. The plaintiff presented numerous documentations including his Russian passport, Austrian identity card and European driving licence to demonstrate how the inclusion of -- had occurred only in the contested instance of his Maltese passport. He stated that this error in his name caused a discrepancy between his local and European documentation which leads to great confusion and inconvenience. He therefore requested the court to alter his name in the Public Registry and in all official citations. On his part the Director of Public Registry stated that the plaintiff’s name had been taken ad verbatim from a translation of his Russian birth certificate, as required by law, and that therefore, in following the law, the defendant should not be liable for the expenses incurred by the court case. The defendant further argued that a Russian legal expert should be nominated to explain why the patronymic name contested by the plaintiff is written in the name column of the Russian birth certificate and whether in the Russian tradition the patronymic name is indeed considered part of a person’s name. Indeed, the court sought the opinion of a Russian law firm which confirmed the name in question, as written on the plaintiff’s Russian birth certificate, merely serves to indicate that he is the son of -- but it is not to be considered part of the plaintiff’s name, as is further proved by its omission from his Russian passport.

The court appointed an expert to analyse the evidence provided which consisted mainly of numerous affidavits provided by the plaintiff and an affidavit by the defendant. The expert was of the opinion that consent for marriage had indeed been obtained through fraud. In his statement, the husband had said that even though his wife had complained of his treatment, saying that he acted as though she were a “prostitute”, she was his wife and he demanded that she accept everything her husband said or did. The court felt that marriage for the defendant meant nothing more than cruelty and domination over the other party and that his idea of marriage did not coincide with that of the civil society he currently lived in. The defendant had declared that in his culture the husband had the right to do whatever he wished without requiring the approval of his wife. The court said this culture and attitude was at odds with Malta’s beliefs. In addition, the defendant had hidden his sterility from his wife even though he had reason to suspect so and knew very well of the plaintiff’s wishes to have children. The court therefore decided in favour of the plaintiff and declared the marriage null and without effect, with court expenses to be borne by the defendant.",Maltese,

The couple had a casual sexual relationship for four years without ever discussing marriage, then one day the defendant took the plaintiff to the Mosque and asked her to marry him. He explained that since they were in the holy month of Ramadan, he was not allowed to have sexual relations with her unless she was his wife. They celebrated a Muslim marriage that day but their relationship remained casual. The plaintiff was comfortable with this arrangement because she wished to continue living on her own. Around two years later, the defendant was arrested by the Immigration Police because he was without a visa and when he told them that he is married to a Maltese woman they paid the plaintiff a visit, however they took the defendant to prison when they discovered that the couple did not cohabit. A short while after the arrest, friends of the husband handed the plaintiff a luggage with all of his belongings and among them, she discovered that the plaintiff had a relationship with an English woman. She confronted him about this but forgave him and feeling sorry for the defendant, accepted to marry him civilly to allow her husband to obtain Maltese citizenship. The couple had a small party on the day of their civil marriage but he immediately made it clear that he had no intention of living with her and she kicked him out of her house when he informed her that he would live with her only if she agreed to have his brother live with them too. They did not reconciliate and separated legally some two years later. The plaintiff’s sister confirmed this version of events adding that their family had always found the parties’ relationship problematic, especially because he was eighteen years younger and there was a large cultural difference between the two. She argued that after meeting the defendant, her sister started dressing differently and she did not meet her family, talk to other persons or even dance with her brother. She also said that she occasionally noticed bruises on her sister but the plaintiff always ended up forgiving him. The court said that it was clear that neither party had intention of living the communal life required by marriage and that the defendant did it out of convenience to obtain citizenship, indeed excluding matrimonial life when on their wedding day the defendant made it clear that he did not intend on living with her.

Both parties presented a very contrasting version of events regarding the duration of their relationship, both before and after nuptials and whose idea it was to marry, with each party accusing the other of violence, infidelity and lack of commitment. The plaintiff claimed that they had met one year before marrying civilly after which the defendant’s attitude turned violent and during which period she even ridiculed her husband for sexual dysfunction caused by the anti-depressant medication he was prescribed. He claimed to have left the family home less than two weeks after the marriage ceremony because he found the environment unbearable, claiming that his wife had married solely to obtain Maltese citizenship. On the other hand, the defendant refuted this claim by saying that they married out of love and that her relationship had indeed started one year prior to what her husband stated, adding that her family had great reservations about their relationship due to cultural and religious differences. In order to please them, the plaintiff had travelled to Morocco to convince her relatives to allow them to marry, he had adopted Islam as his religion and even changed his name to Ali, an Arab name. She claimed that after marriage both her husband and his family had started ridiculing her religion and he even had the audacity of eating pork during Ramadan. He had lied about the medication he was on claiming it was for muscle pain, only to discover from a pharmacist that they were tranquillizers for persons with a history of drug dependence. The court was of the opinion that notwithstanding their conflicting version of events, it was clear that the marriage lasted very little because both parties lacked the concept of permanent union and that there was no commitment for the consent to have legal value. The consent, said the court, is thrown in more doubt when taking into consideration the psychological difficulties of the plaintiff. The court therefore acceded to the request and declared the marriage null with court expenses to be divided between the parties.",Maltese,

The parties’ version of events differed greatly with each accusing the other of lack of commitment and infidelity. The plaintiff stated that the marriage had occurred after a courtship of three weeks and that her husband had left their family home one year later, never returning except in short intervals. She said that the cultural and religious differences had immediately been felt as the defendant insisted that in Islam and in his home country, the woman needs to be of service to her husband. She claimed that he therefore controlled every aspect of her life including clothing and make-up use, and did not allow her to maintain contact with her family. He allowed her to work because he was comfortable allowing her to be the breadwinner but often would send money to his family in Egypt without consulting her. She claimed that the defendant demanded that she after work, he did not allow her to go out if not in his presence. The husband, she argued, would go to the lengths of smelling his wife to make sure that she did not consume pork products which were not allowed in the household. He had even told her that one day or another she would have to convert to Islam. She added that he had always sought to have a Muslim wife and indeed his current partner is Tunisian. A short while after marrying, the plaintiff had discovered that her husband’s visa had been expired for three years and thus started to believe that he had rushed her into a marriage of convenience. In his statement, the defendant said that his expired visa was not a secret and that he was willing to return to his home country as he was qualified and would have easily found a good occupation. He said that the day before nuptials he discovered that she had lied to him regarding previous relationships and that she had been with various men before him. This, he said, angered him as his religion did not permit relationships outside marriage. He argued that he nonetheless forgave her. He rejected the claim that he had left the family home stating that he had forgiven her various transgressions which included her being seen with other men while they were still married. He further argued that once he invited her to Egypt to visit his family but she refused saying that he would then mistreat her because that is what she had seen in films. The defendant stated that he had always seen marriage as a serious issue which required sincere commitment and that he had entered the marriage with the firm belief that she was the one for him as he would never have found anyone better. He however conceded that there could never be dialogue between them because they had different characters and the cultural differences were too profound, with his wife living her life as though they were not married. The court judged there to be a serious defect of discretion of judgment on the matrimonial life as the couple barely knew each other before marrying and decisions of such importance should not be taken lightly. In this sense the court found the defendant’s version of events not credible as it is not clear why they had hurried into such a marriage if not because it allowed him to obtain citizenship. The defendant had said that he had no problem in returning to his country but he clearly preferred living in Malta as he continued doing so to the present day. The court found the defendant’s statement of firmly believing in the institution of marriage as contradictory to such a short courtship and even though in his statement he had seemed well aware of the duties and obligations that marriage brings with it, he still agreed to marry a person he was clearly incompatible with. In addition, the defendant’s admission that his family came before everything else and his dominator attitude towards his wife are at odds to Malta’s values and laws which consider both parties as equals in the marriage. The court therefore acceded to the plaintiff’s requests and granted the annulment with court expenses to be divided equally between both parties.",Maltese,

The issue revolved around an incident that had occurred forty-six years prior, during a period of intense rivalry between two band clubs and parishes. During the night before the celebration of one feast, members of the rival band club had entered the basilica and parish church dedicated to the saint and stole the wings from his statue, thus effectively cancelling the procession that should have been accompanied by the respective band club. At the time, a brother of the defamed person served as a journalist for a local newspaper and had been following the magisterial enquiry that ensued following the theft. He found out that the police were suspecting of a local priest as their main suspect; the deceased's brother, through his own contacts, discovered the identity of at least one of the culprits, but promised not to reveal his identity. Upon realising that the police were going to wrongfully accuse an innocent person, the journalist met the perpetrator and gave him the ultimatum of producing the stolen artefacts. He even offered to help deliver the stolen objects to the Basilica using the family van which was covered with a distinctive insignia of a product that they locally distributed. This distinctive van was seen delivering the stolen wings and word spread that it had been the journalist’s brother, who usually drove the van that stole the items but returned them after a change of heart. The rumours were further reinforced when the journalist’s brother died after being struck by a car’s mudguard; a car part often revered to in Gozo as “ġewnaħ”, literal translation “wings”. Local inhabitants saw the clear irony and interpreted it as a divine retribution for having stolen the saintly wings. The author went on to appeal the decision by the lower court finding him guilty of defaming the memory of a deceased person and ordering him to pay a fine of 200 Maltese lira (€85.86). The appellant’s arguments were that he did not intend to vilify the accused, that as the title suggested, a legend should never be taken seriously or factually, and that what he wrote was protected by laws protecting freedom of speech and expression. The Court of Appeals court threw out these arguments on the basis that intent is not required, that the so-called legend is no more than truth mixed with heresy and that people knowledgeable of the event could easily attribute the theft to the deceased. In addition, the court said that liberties carry duties and responsibilities, in this case towards a non-public person against whom untruths were written and not verified. The court confirmed the guilty sentence but accepted the honest intentions of the author who had excluded this particular “legend” from a second edition of the book. The court therefore reduced the fine to 20 Maltese lira (€8.59).",Maltese,

The defendant agreed to the request of annulment but asked the court that all expenses be borne by the plaintiff as the marriage had failed due to reasons attributable entirely to him. The plaintiff admitted in the court that he had entered into a marriage of convenience and that he had only done so because he was nearing the expiration date of his student visa and wished to remain in Malta and bring his mother with him. He presented numerous affidavits of friends and relatives who confirmed his version of events that his sole goal was to obtain citizenship. In addition, he demanded certain conditions for marriage such as that his mother would live with them and that they do not have any children as he did not wish to raise his children in a culture so different to his. The marriage in fact ended up failing because of clashes between the defendant and her mother-in-law. The court noted how in an ever more multicultural society, persons are entering ill-thought marriages bound for failure because parties are unwilling to accept each other’s cultures and traditions. The court therefore accepted the plaintiff’s requests and ordered the dissolution of the marriage with court expenses to be divided equally, as the defendant had entered the marriage willingly, knowing very well the plaintiff’s thought process and yet she had acceded to the plaintiff’s wishes.",Maltese,

The issue came to light when the plaintiff received a complaint regarding the company’s entrance ramp which was too steep, rendering independent access for a wheelchair-bound person impossible. The problem was particularly egregious because the company in question sold machinery intended for use by persons with disability. The plaintiffs had immediately contacted the company but initiated legal proceedings a year later as the various meetings and correspondences brought no tangible results. The plaintiff requested that the court order the defendant to make the necessary alterations to render the building accessible to persons with disability, in accordance with the relevant regulations. The defendant made various claims about the legal basis of the case, adding that access for persons with disability was in fact present, that the quoted law was not retroactive in nature and that the only discrimination taking place was towards the defendant company itself as the plaintiff seemed to be reserving them particular attention while ignoring many other buildings, including public, which had no access whatsoever for persons with disability. The court refuted the defendant’s claims that the plaintiff’s request was unfounded in law and noted how the access for persons with disability referred to by the defendant was intended for the adjacent building with no clear signage on how one was to arrive in the building in question. The court noted how the primary intent of the law in question was to give dignity to persons with disability by providing access in the proximity of a building’s normal entrance, without forcing them to take improbable routes or concealed passageways. Regarding the retroactivity of the law, the court discredited this claim by quoting the relevant Minister of Government who during the parliamentary discussions regarding the law had said that many national treasures were not being enjoyed by a substantial section of the society and thus there is a duty to make amends and render these places accessible. In the court’s opinion the law intended to guarantee complete integration into society for persons with disability by giving them the opportunity to live independent lives within the community. This required material changes but more importantly changes in Maltese culture and mentality and therefore the lack of retroactivity would render the law useless considering the amount of development that had already occurred on the Island prior to the enactment of the Act in question. In addition, it threw out the defendant’s claims of discrimination in their regards as the plaintiff had merely acted on a complaint they had received. The court therefore found that the steep ramp did not make independent access to the building possible and found the company guilty of discrimination towards persons with disability, ordering the defendant to apply for the relevant permits within two weeks of the judgement with completion of the works to occur within two months of obtaining the relevant permits.",Maltese,

The parties met during the summer months but only a week later he was caught by the Maltese authorities working without the necessary documentation and consequently deported. The couple retained contact by the telephone and the plaintiff agreed to travel to Egypt to meet him. Upon landing in Egypt, the defendant presented her with two rings, one for their engagement and the other for their marriage. She objected to them marrying as she had only met him a few weeks before, but he reassured her that all they had to do was get engaged as his father would not have allowed them to live together in the family residence without them being formally committed to each other. The plaintiff, twenty-one years old at the time, claimed during the court proceedings that she was reckless and immature and considered the whole event as an adventure. She argued, she agreed to her husband’s plan because she did not consider engagement a serious commitment and at the same time could not refuse the offer as she did not know anyone in Egypt and did not have anywhere to stay. That evening a ceremony was held at the defendant’s family home, during which the plaintiff recounts that a casually dressed man had arrived and carried out with an Arabic ritual in the company of a few neighbours. She understood nothing of what was being said and only later did her husband tell her that they were now married in Islam. She accepted her husband’s claim that he was forced by his father who worried of what people would say, and some months later she returned to Egypt with the necessary documentation for their marriage to be registered. Upon pressure from the plaintiff’s mother, who was also worried about people’s gossip, a Christian marriage was celebrated in Malta. This had been anticipated as in the meantime the plaintiff had fallen pregnant. The plaintiff claimed that her husband soon became violent, possessive and sexually forceful on numerous occasions both before and after giving birth. The plaintiff argued that she bore years of violence and abuse both towards herself and their child but upon finding his infidelity, she initiated separation and then the annulment proceedings. The court lamented about the ever-increasing cases of marriage of convenience arriving before the courts, most of which involved men from differing cultural backgrounds who, after obtaining the marriage which granted them freedom of movement and labour in Malta started mistreating their wives and sometimes even their children. The court noted the recklessness with which parties entered into these marriages of convenience, with the sole intention of regularising the legal status of at least one of them, and how this was becoming a regular occurrence in the Maltese courts. The court agreed that in the case at hand there were indeed exceptional circumstances that would justify the annulment of the marriage, thus acceding to the plaintiff’s request and ordering expenses to be borne by the defendant who was absent from the court proceedings.",Maltese,

The Maltese plaintiff met his future wife when she visited the company he worked at in search of work. She was of Syrian origin, brought up in England. Her family subsequently moved to the United Arab Emirates (UAE). She repudiated the Arab way of life and had refused to learn the Arabic language and had ended up being expelled from college because her attitude was considered too westernized. She then arrived in Malta with the intent of completing a University course and sought the plaintiff’s help as she did not wish to return to the Middle East. Soon after, the two began dating and she started sharing her concerns regarding her permanence in Malta as she was nearing the end of her course and feared getting expelled from the country once her student visa expired. The plaintiff claimed that she made him believe that she would not even be allowed to live in the UAE and would end up being sent to Syria, a country she had never lived in before. At this point she suggested that they get married in order to secure permanent residency in Malta. The plaintiff argued that they married after a lot of insistence and pressure on her part. After marrying civilly and Islamically, the plaintiff recounted that problems started to emerge. He claimed she did not like that he worked long hours and showed very little interest in the plaintiff and his parents who at the time were passing through very serious illnesses. Moreover, the defendant failed to maintain employment and the couple’s relationship deteriorated until the relationship both physically and romantically died. Three years after marrying the defendant left for the UAE and never returned. The plaintiff said that the three years of marriage were characterized by constant fighting and that they never lived a couple’s life and had no thought of raising a family. The court concurred with the plaintiffs claim in this regard, saying that the couple were not ready to bear the essential duties of marriage.

The parties met while members of the “Christian Fellowship”, a closed religious denomination managed primarily by Nigerian nationals, which requested one-tenth of the members’ profits. The plaintiff said that this organization, which he had enlisted into with his brother at a very young age, ordered its adherents to marry from within and this greatly limited his choice of spouses. Moreover, the religious group forbade its members from having sexual relations out of marriage. He argued that he took its teachings so seriously that it affected his consent. The couple had numerous arguments even prior to marrying and had he not felt pressured to proceed with this marriage, he argued, he would not have gone along with it. The parties had agreed to marry one year after making acquaintance and did so a year later. The plaintiff said that problems started emerging immediately and they had erroneously thought that having children would solve the issues. In hindsight, the plaintiff believes that he had married in order to satiate his natural needs while the defendant had rushed into the marriage to escape her oppressive household. The defendant rejected the plaintiff’s claims that his consent had been impaired in anyway and said that the plaintiff’s attitude had changed after marriage. After the birth of their son a year after nuptials, he had started working very long hours and the defendant felt that the family started losing its values due to lack of communication. It was on the workplace that the plaintiff met the person with whom he eventually cheated on his spouse. The defendant said that the marriage ended when the plaintiff refused to leave that workplace. The defendant stressed how in no way had her husband forced or brainwashed her into marrying and that the religious group had served only of benefit to them. She presented numerous witness accounts to bolster her claims, including the plaintiff’s brother who was married to the defendant’s sister and other high-ranking members of the group. They confirmed how it was plaintiff’s excessive work hours and infidelity that led to the marriage demise and that while it was true that the organization recommended marrying people of the same beliefs and ideally persons from within the religious denomination, at no stage did it force its members to do so. The court found that the evidence showed that the plaintiff’s consent was in no way extorted, especially since numerous members of the said group married non-adherents. The court argued the plaintiff failed to prove that his consent was affected by outside interference. However, it concluded that the circumstances that developed were entirely attributable to the plaintiff, in the sense that he was so absorbed in the organization and at a stage even worked hard towards obtaining a high-ranking position within it that it controlled every aspect of his life. He was dedicated to following every principle and guideline extolled by the group and in this case felt that his conscience did not allow him to marry outside of the religious denomination, especially because he had great ambitions to climb the hierarchal ladder within it. This greatly restricted his choice of partner, said the court, and it was this state of mind that clouded his judgement and vitiated his consent. The court therefore declared the marriage null due to reasons attributable solely to the plaintiff and court expenses were thus to be borne by the plaintiff.",Maltese,

The plaintiff recounted how she had started visiting a Libyan fortune-teller during a period of great personal difficulty which included depression and financial difficulties. The fortune teller started gaining the plaintiff’s trust after a series of correct predictions on her life and promised her that she would find happiness with a man of a foreign nationality. The fortune teller repeated the same thing at every meeting and told her that this man she will marry would also save her from her financial difficulties. Five months after first meeting, the fortune teller introduced the plaintiff to the defendant who was also a regular client and she told the plaintiff that this was the man she had been talking about all along. The plaintiff who at the time had a severe depression and was by then visiting the fortune teller daily, took up her recommendation to date the defendant. Three months into their courtship the defendant suggested that they would marry and the plaintiff agreed to it as long as it was done in secret. Indeed, after their civil marriage, the couple remained living apart in order to give the plaintiff time to tell her family and in fact they never ended up cohabitating. With the help of her sister and proper medication, the plaintiff claimed she came to realise that she had made a mistake and told the defendant that she did not love him. Her husband tried to convince her this meant nothing as in in his culture love came after marriage, but from that point on the parties did not seek each other and the plaintiff succeeded in starting a romantic relationship with a Maltese man. The court noted how the plaintiff who at the time suffered from psychiatric difficulties had become dependent on the fortune teller and thus consent to marriage had never been entirely hers with the court describing the actions of the fortune teller as “brainwashing”. In addition, the couple had entered the marriage with the idea of excluding essentials elements of marriage including procreation and cohabitation.

The plaintiff recounted how the pair had met in a discotheque and four months later the defendant had begun insisting that they get married. The woman had a son from a previous relationship and was relieved that the defendant was willing to accept her previous life and child, while at the same time providing the stability she sought. The plaintiff claimed that the marriage celebration was a casual affair with the plaintiff leaving from work to celebrate the nuptials and returning to her workplace once the event was over. Her family was kept in dark for seven months following their marriage and straight away difficulties began emerging with her husband refusing to take care of her son and living as though he were still a bachelor. According to the plaintiff, the defendant had a low salary and was financially dependent on her, he refused to have children and was often violent, leading the plaintiff to file numerous reports with the police. She recounted that it was when her husband left the household to spend two months in his home country that she refused any attempts for reconciliation. She said that prior to marrying, he had told her that since she is a single mother, he was her only chance of having a stable relationship; no other man would have accepted her under those circumstances. On the other hand, the defendant said that the plaintiff was violent, jealous and possessive and that it was she who insisted on them getting married. He accused her of infidelity, something he deemed unacceptable in the Arab culture. The court took issue with the defendant’s version of events and felt that he had married solely to obtain a permanent residence permit as he currently had a work permit through his employment as a professional footballer. It noted how this was becoming an ever-increasing occurrence and that in this instance the defendant exploited the plaintiff and her fears of living as a single mother. The court concluded that the defendant had no intention of living the married life and demonstrated lack of interest in raising her son or working for the family, in addition to his extra-marital affairs. The evidence to support his lack of commitment was even more damning, said the court, when considering that according to him his culture did not allow him to stay with a woman who had been with other men, which was at odds with what he had agreed to by getting married to her in the first place. The court argued that the parties entered the marriage without any preparation and the fact that the defendant did not want any children further proved that he had simulated consent. On the other hand, the court noted how the plaintiffs need to have a man care for her and her son seemed to be the only factor that motivated the plaintiff into a hurried marriage, with little thought to the responsibilities that this brought with it.

The couple had been introduced by a common acquaintance who was Tunisian and the plaintiff became quickly infatuated by her. The plaintiff invited her to live with his family and she started sleeping in her own room and would lock the door, not even allowing the plaintiff to enter. After a few weeks she started talking to the plaintiff about marriage and although he was interested, he also noticed that she had a very cold attitude in his regard. She would not allow him to touch her and would tell him that her Muslim religion did not allow him to even caress her prior to marriage. Less than two months after meeting, they married without telling anyone especially because the plaintiff sensed that his sister did not approve. The plaintiff recounts how the defendant had brought up marriage some ten times in the span of two weeks and that she organized everything herself for the occasion. It was such a hurried affair that the plaintiff did not even have adequate clothing and asked his sister for clothing for a party without telling her of his true intentions. The parties continued living in different rooms and the defendant continued not allowing the plaintiff any affection. She came up with various excuses on why they could not be intimate; at times because he needed to get circumcised and on other occasions she told him that they had to first marry in Tunisia. On the other hand, on numerous occasions the plaintiff’s siblings told him that they had seen her in the company of another man. A month after marrying, the defendant and the plaintiff’s sister had a violent argument when the latter found out that the defendant received a large sum of money by her newly-wed husband. The defendant took her things and left, never to be seen again by the plaintiff. The court said that based on the evidence provided the nullity of the marriage had been sufficiently proven due to the fact that the defendant had married because it was convenient for her and only did it for her egoistic and personal goals.

The couple had met two years prior to marrying and at the onset the plaintiff did not know about the problems regarding the defendant’s legal status. Sometime later, she discovered that he was working in Malta illegally and if caught would be deported back to his home-country. At this point the plaintiff started going to the Immigration Department to help the defendant extend his visa, something she claimed to have found very stressful. The parties decided that they could only regularise the defendant’s long-term position by getting married. The plaintiff said that the defendant pressured her in this regard and insisted that the marriage should occur before Malta’s ascension into the European Union as from that day onwards there would have been more stringent rules regarding the issue of visas. She claimed that although she felt she was marrying out of love, she could not get herself to tell her family as she knew they would disapprove. The plaintiff admitted that before marrying the couple only discussed about marriage and residence without talking about married life, family or the future. Indeed, because the marriage was carried out in secret, the couple spent a few years living apart. The plaintiff noted how even after starting to cohabit, her husband maintained the same life he had before, leaving financial responsibility in the hands of his wife, while he spent most of his time with his friends and often arriving home very late at night. In addition, while before marriage he seemed open-minded about the plaintiff’s differing culture and religion, she felt that his attitude changed and these differences started being an issue of contention. She complained that he placed his family first and demanded that the plaintiff stop consuming certain foods and begin observing Ramadan. The plaintiff claimed that she realised many years later that the defendant tricked her into marriage solely to obtain Maltese citizenship and the attached benefits. The defendant on his part agreed to the request for annulment but rejected the idea that he had any concerns regarding his legal status in Malta and said marriage had been the plaintiff’s idea. He believed that her family had objected to their marriage due to their racial and religious differences and that the marriage had ended up collapsing because she had refused to have children, probably due to pressure from her family who did not wish their children to be Muslim. The court found that both testimonies proved that neither party had the intention of forming a family and the bond required by marriage. The defendant’s legal status in Malta seemed to be their sole motivator and the fact that they had spent the first years after marriage living apart clearly showed how they had not established the conjugal life required by marriage.

The defendant had arrived in Malta due to family issues and when in Malta, he found out that his brother had a food joint of his own. The couple then met at a Turkish food establishment owned by the defendant and started dating soon after. During their courtship of about nine months the plaintiff had started working on a part-time basis at the takeout of the defendant’s brother, and the two started each other daily, as he had even stopped working at his establishment to spend time with the plaintiff. When he asked her to marry him the plaintiff hesitated as her family greatly disapproved. In her statement, the plaintiff’s mother said that they had opposed her hurried marriage because the defendant was a foreigner and of differing culture. After first refusing, at a first instance, the plaintiff went along with the marriage in order to “rebel against her family” and the nuptials were carried out in secret. A few days later, they rented an apartment and found out that her husband was still without a work permit. The newly-wed wife said that her husband’s attitude changed completely after going to the Department for Citizenship and Expatriate Affairs and receiving assurance that he would be obtaining all the work and residence permits. From that moment onwards he started returning home in the early hours of the morning, and after two weeks of being ignored, the plaintiff returned to her mother who welcomed her back. She recounts how a few days later the defendant had gone to her parents' home to tell her that he did not need her anymore as he was going to be given all the permits he necessitated. The defendant then left for his home-country, returning for a short period of time but leaving again when his business venture failed. At the time of court proceedings, the plaintiff had not seen the defendant for seven years.

They started dating soon after and four months later started living together in the house of the plaintiff’s sister. The couple got married after eight months courting with the plaintiff accusing his wife of being rash and doing things without thinking of the consequences such as her describing marriage as ‘a piece of paper’. The plaintiff accused the defendant of changing after marriage; becoming possessive and jealous and finding great issue with the long hours the plaintiff spent training for athletics. She was not used to living alone and remained heavily dependent on others to do things for her. The plaintiff complained that the defendant often went out on her own and accused her of adultery, which she vehemently denied until she fell pregnant and could no longer conceal her infidelity. On her part, the defendant stated that her family had immediately shown opposition to her relationship with the plaintiff because he was a foreigner. They warned her about an inevitable clash due to their differing cultures and religions and told her that the plaintiff would give her little importance because he could marry a total of seven women. The defendant objected to her family’s intromission and argued that she left the family house and went to live with the plaintiff to spite her family. The defendant accused the plaintiff of restricting her social life, entertainment choices and use of make-up. She said that she started seeking other men to compensate for the lack of attention she received from her husband while simultaneously admitting being immature and entering marriage without due consideration.

The defendant, born in Syria to Palestinian parents, married the plaintiff after a one-year courtship, three years after he arrived in Malta. The marriage occurred after he was brought in by police and ordered to regularise his legal status within three months or face deportation. The marriage was carried out in secret because the plaintiff’s parents disapproved as they felt that the defendant was using their daughter in order to remain in Malta. Due to financial difficulties, the plaintiff and their daughter of six months agreed to go live for a period with the defendant’s relatives in Syria. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant’s family members took her passport and did not allow her to leave, at which point her parents in Malta contacted the Maltese Consulate in Syria and travelled to the country in order to get them back. According to the plaintiff, the relationship broke down because the defendant’s attitude changed after marriage, becoming distant, possessive and aggressive while hiding money from their grocery business. The plaintiff also claimed that a further strain on the relationship was the situation of their daughter. When she was two years old, they went for a holiday in Syria, at which point the defendant recommended that they leave their daughter behind for a year, something the plaintiff had initially agreed to. However, by the time of sentencing, the court noted that their daughter had not yet returned from Syria and, apart from regular video chats, had not met her parents for twelve years. Their fourteen-year-old daughter had not been brought back to Malta because both parents needed to go to do so but the father could not travel to Syria because he did not have a Syrian passport as he had not completed military duty, and meanwhile a civil war had broken out making travelling to Syria dangerous. In addition, the court noted that Syria was not a signatory to the Hague Convention, raising concerns about the treatment that their daughter might receive should she be abducted. In his version of events, the defendant believed that the plaintiff’s family disapproval of their relationship was due to their racist beliefs as they did not wish her to marry a foreigner of differing religion, even though he had always loved and respected his wife. He refuted the plaintiff’s claim to their home and said that he should receive custody of their child as she was raised in Syrian culture and would find it difficult to adapt to life with her Maltese family. The court found the defendant guilty of mistreatment and excesses towards his wife and described him as manipulative who took advantage of a naïve woman. The court argued that the defendant said he came to Malta in search of a better life while at the same time thinking that it was in his daughter’s best interest for her to continue living in a war-torn country. The court agreed that the child was to be brought back to Malta and custody given to her mother, with the defendant only given access during supervised visits, while granting the plaintiff sole access to the family home.

The plaintiff then received a call from a friend to tell her that there was an Arab man who wanted to get to know her after seeing her out on the street with the children. The plaintiff argued that she initially hesitated because she could not fathom why someone would be interested in her considering that she had bad teeth, but she went along with it a few days later. Upon meeting, the defendant told her he had his family in Egypt but travelled to Malta every fortnight, thus explaining his fluency in the Maltese language. Barely half an hour had passed that he asked her to marry him, telling the plaintiff that Arabs married on the whim and did not ponder about it much. He promised on the Quran that he would financially provide for her and her children while finding accommodation for them to live in as one family. The plaintiff took two days to think it through before acceding to the defendant’s request.

They communicated via Skype for four months after which point she informed him that she did not intend on returning and wanted a divorce. The plaintiff’s attempts to convince her otherwise proved futile and he soon lost all contact.

He requested that the changes be carried out on his birth certificate and consequently in all other official documentation. The plaintiff explained that he was born and registered in one name but years later came to be known, in society as well as on the workplace, by a different name. This change, he explained, was brought about upon by his conversion to Buddhism during which spiritual rite it is customary to be given a Tibetan name, which in his case was R. D. O. J.  He added that it was common among Tibetans to abbreviate the name. When asked by the court why he did not adopt the name in its entirety, the plaintiff explained that he made the choice for practicality since he lived in Western Culture and felt that the one-syllable name would be a good adaptation. He added that he does not identify with the given name and that the name felt foreign. The Director of Public Registry objected to the proposed change and quoted the law in question which specifically prohibited any changes from occurring if this simply involved shortening or abbreviations of the name registered at birth. The Director presented a search from three different websites which all stated that that name is the English language diminutive of another name and discussed German and Dutch abbreviations. A judicial request for name change, claimed the defendant, is permissible only to remove confusion regarding the identification of a person, while in this case persons who knew the plaintiff by that name would certainly not be confused upon reading his actual as that could be simply an abbreviation. In addition, no error had occurred during registration of his name at time of birth and therefore the defendant was not liable for any court costs incurred. The court concurred with the defendant’s position stating that apart from the specific mention in the cited law which prohibited names changes from occurring for abbreviations, corrections are only allowed if mistakes had taken place or when as time goes by the registered name gets to be known differently.

The couple had married after a courtship of six years, during which period the defendant had not been entirely candid with the plaintiff. He had initially told her that he was a Spanish citizen and had not told her that he was already married to another Maltese woman, a fact she found out only after his wife came knocking at the plaintiff’s door. The plaintiff however forgave the defendant and he subsequently obtained a divorce from the Islamic Court of Latakia in Syria. The plaintiff put forward a number of conditions prior to getting married and these included raising their children in the Christian faith and obtaining financial security allowing them to secure a comfortable life and private schooling. The defendant agreed to these requests and had signed a document obligating himself, should they have children, to raise them in the Christian faith. The couple subsequently got married in Church and their first children, born less than a year later, was baptised in accordance with Christian tradition. Things quickly turned sour, with the plaintiff stating that the defendant changed dramatically after marriage becoming very aggressive with multiple police reports filed detailing acts of violence perpetrated by the defendant. The family’s finances rested entirely on the shoulders of the plaintiff with very little contribution from the defendant who instead preferring to send money to his home country in aid of his parents and brothers. He also came short of his religious obligations, barring his daughter from carrying out her First Communion and Confirmation, with the former being carried out in secret to the fury of the defendant. The plaintiff also reported various threats issued by the defendant to their daughter ordering her not to attend mass or catechism. The court found that the defendant had been deceitful straight from the onset of their relationship and that he did not abide by marriage obligations founded on respect and love between the couple, but instead married solely for his egoistic purposes.

The couple had married five months after first acquainting and both were in agreement that they had married so the defendant would be allowed to stay in Malta. The Libyan defendant had found great opposition from his family who did not approve of his relationship with the plaintiff, a person of differing culture and religious belief. Upon discovering of their relationship, his uncle fired him from work and his father had arranged for him to be betrothed to a total stranger, as was expected from the eldest son of the family. A few days before the arranged engagement, the defendant fled the country into the arms of the plaintiff. He was on a 2-week visa and they reasoned that the only way for him to remain in Malta and escape his family’s grasp was for them to get married. Upon informing his family of his decision to marry in Malta his father told him that he had been disinherited, but the couple nonetheless went along with the marriage. The defendant however found it difficult to adapt to life in such a foreign culture and had encountered problems at work. In addition, the plaintiff had insisted that they buy an apartment of their own and the financial burden placed further stress on their relationship with both parties accusing each other of infidelity. The lower court had found that it had not been proven that there was any defect of discretion of judgment or lack of reflection; indeed, notwithstanding their short courtship, all evidence pointed towards the fact that the couple had married out of love and conviction. The court had pointed to their affidavits in which they stated that before marrying the plaintiff had asked the defendant if he felt ready for marriage, at which point he had answered that he was, aided by the fact that he came from a culture that gave priority to the family and little time to personal enjoyment. The lower court argued that this fact shows they were well aware of the duties of marriage and the difficulties they encountered were attributable to a wrong life choice for which separation and not annulment applied. The Court of Appeals found issue with this interpretation, stating that the pressure the defendant was put under by his family and his will to escape their impositions, certainly affected his thinking process and thus consent was vitiated by a serious defect of discretion of judgment on the matrimonial life or on its essential rights and duties. The court therefore acceded to the plaintiff’s demands by declaring the marriage null with court expenses to be divided equally between the parties.",Maltese,

The court concluded that the defendant’s attitude seemed to be influenced by her country’s culture whereby marriage annulments can be obtained with relative ease, while at the same time the plaintiff proved himself to be immature and blinded by infatuation towards the defendant, as he should have taken note of the numerous red flags prior to marrying the defendant.

The child was a British national, a son to a British mother and an estranged Maltese father. The couple had a relationship that lasted for four years, but which ended once the woman fell pregnant. She gave birth to their child in Scotland and from that moment on she strived to obtain Maltese citizenship for her offspring as she wished to expose him to both cultures and provide him with all the opportunities given to both British and Maltese Citizens. At the time, Article 17(1)(a) Chapter 188 of the Laws of Malta stipulated that if a child was born out of wedlock they automatically took the mother’s surname, with all reference to the father expunged. This stood at odds with Article 5(2)(b) of the Laws of Malta which stipulated that every child born in Malta or abroad was to be given Maltese citizenship at birth if at least one of the parents was Maltese. At first, she was reassured by Maltese Authorities that citizenship would be offered if she could prove the paternity and if consequently the Scottish birth certificate was registered also in Malta. After failing to solve the issue directly with her ex-partner, the plaintiff resorted to instituting legal proceedings during which a DNA test confirmed the Maltese national as the child’s father and stipulated the maintenance costs. However, when the plaintiff attempted to register the child’s updated birth certificate which listed the father as indeed the Maltese national, the Public Registry had explained to her that in order to register the child’s birth certificate in Malta, the child would need to have Maltese Citizenship. It was explained to the plaintiff that the Maltese Parliament never had the intention of conferring Maltese citizenship to the “illegitimate” children of Maltese men. The plaintiff was left with no other option but to open proceedings against the unconstitutionality of such a law, arguing that it discriminated against children born out of wedlock. The State justified its stance with regard to Maltese Law, adding that citizenship is not a right derived from the Convention as it is not considered a ‘fundamental’ right. The court delved into Article 45 of the Maltese Constitution which legislated against discrimination. The court found that Article 17(1)(a) of Chapter 188 of the Laws of Malta was indeed discriminatory based on sex and therefore in violation of the Maltese Constitution, ordering court expenses to be borne by the defendants and a copy of the sentence to be sent to the Speaker of the House of Representatives of Malta for the necessary amendments in the law.",Maltese,

The couple met on the bus when the plaintiff was thirty-one years old and the defendant was eleven years older. They married less than six months after getting to know each other, but their courtship lasted no more than half that time as at a certain point the plaintiff had left for a few months for his home country. The plaintiff was a non-practicing Muslim and the marriage was a very casual affair with only the witnesses present and with both parties returning to work after the celebration was over. No reception or honeymoon ever occurred, instead both went abroad with the defendant going on a pre-planned holiday with friends and her newly-wed husband travelling in order to end his employment at sea. The marriage started turning sour after around four years of marriage with the defendant professing that he spent too much time with his friends. On his part, the plaintiff lamented the fact that he did not find in his wife the partner he had wished for as she did not provide the support, intimacy and communication one is permitted to expect in marriage. They gradually drifted apart from each other until the defendant found out about her husband’s infidelity, at which point they filed for separation. The plaintiff had immediately made it clear that he did not wish to have children due to the advanced age of the defendant and indeed no children resulted after ten years of marriage. The court found that even though the defendant did not make any claims in this regard, it was evident that the sole interest of the plaintiff was the obtainment of residency and labour rights, as often occurs with people arriving from less developed countries, said the court. The court pondered on why a thirty-year-old in the prime of his life would be attracted so fiercely to a forty-two-year-old woman if not to obtain citizenship. And indeed, his wish not to have children should be seen in this light said the court, claiming that the plaintiff can be seen as a person who wants to avoid family ties in order to return to his home country and start life anew at whatever point he wanted. The court argued it was clear that the plaintiff lacked the commitment or wish to help, respect and self-sacrifice for the defendant. The court continued that the plaintiff on her part proved to be immature in spite of her age and succumbed to pressures to get married, ignoring the words of advice from her family members who had suspected the plaintiff’s real intentions. The court argued that she entered a marriage with a much younger person with differing religious and cultural beliefs, without properly evaluating the consequences and therefore lacked the sufficient maturity to judge, reason, and make a practical evaluation of the nature and essential obligations of marriage. The court judged that since it had already been proved that the marriage was vitiated by a serious defect of discretion of judgment on the matrimonial life, it was not necessary to analyse the other grounds of annulment and acceded to the plaintiff’s request for annulment and ordering court expenses to be divided equally by the parties.",Maltese,

The plaintiff met the defendant of Egyptian origin, a few months after the death of her previous husband who had left her alone caring for three children. The plaintiff’s deceased husband had been the sole breadwinner and his death flung her into financial difficulties as she had never worked before and at the same time had three young children to care for. In addition, her two male children had started frequenting the wrong crowd and were having frequent run-ins with the police. The parties in this case were introduced by a common friend who asked her if she wanted the company of an Arab man and although she was still grieving her husband’s death, she claimed to have agreed to meet him because she longed for someone who would help her raise her children while at the same time providing financial security. The defendant travelled regularly to Malta and he surprised her by how well he spoke Maltese. Few minutes had passed during their first encounter when the defendant asked her to marry him. This surprised her, and while not immediately accepting, she agreed to go along with the marriage after only two weeks of courtship. He had assured her that he was very rich in his home country and that he would provide more than enough for her and her children. He also promised to take her with him to Egypt to see his family, something that excited her as she had never been abroad. Her daughter objected to her mother’s marriage and told her that she had heard stories of locals marrying Arabs who quickly find out that they had only done so in order obtain citizenship. The plaintiff however went along with the marriage as she felt lonely and longed for the financial help he had promised her. He refused to marry in Church, telling the plaintiff that his Muslim religion did not allow him to do so. The plaintiff did not see or hear from the defendant for two days after the nuptials were celebrated and when they did finally meet the defendant asked her to sign some papers for him regarding his legal status. He told her that he needed to visit his home country but would remain in contact with her and send her family money. That was the last time she heard from him and had lost all contact at the time of proceedings which took place eleven years later. The plaintiff confessed that the marriage had never been consummated and in actual fact she never even had the opportunity to kiss him.

When the couple had first met, the defendant had been trying to remain in Malta as he sought to avoid compulsory military service in his home-country. The defendant then left for about a year and upon returning when he was twenty-four years of age, he quickly convinced the plaintiff, which was sixteen at the time, to marry him. They married by civil union as she was too young to marry by religious rites but the defendant promised the plaintiff that when she got older they would marry even in Church. After marrying they went to live with the plaintiff’s parents and spent a year there, after which point the defendant left the household and started renting a place for himself and never invited the plaintiff to live with him. The plaintiff said that they were different from other couples in the fact that they rarely went out together and the moments of intimacy were few and far between. Although he lived on his own, it was the plaintiff that paid rent and he continued to be financially dependent on her. In addition, he rarely contacted his wife and would visit her at her parent’s home once every month. The marriage ended when the plaintiff confirmed her husband’s infidelity by questioning a woman whose car would often times be parked in front of the defendant’s residence. The court was of the opinion that the defendant had entered into the contract of marriage with no intention of adhering to the essential elements of marriage as requested by the law. It was clear, said the court, that the defendant’s plan all along had been that to obtain a Visa while retaining the life of bachelor, thus excluding a priori the long-lasting union that is required by marriage.

The plaintiff’s argument was that his partner was five months pregnant with his child and sending her back to her home-country would, due to family, cultural and religious issues, place the foetus in a clear and imminent danger as the woman would be forced into having an abortion. The defendant contested the plaintiff’s role in proceedings arguing that he did not have the judicial right to stand in the name of a third party while the plaintiff’s claims of paternity were premature as they could not be proven at that stage. In addition, it would compromise Malta’s fundamental right of state sovereignty and the law did not contemplate reunification of couples with an unborn child. The defendant argued that it was incorrect to say that the defendant was ordering the woman’s removal, as by law, a person who does not have a residence permit is considered to have never set foot on the Island and can remain solely to be sent back. The court allowed the plaintiff to stand in for his partner and their unborn child as it deemed him to have judicial, direct and personal interest in the proceedings. However, a court judgement on the matter proved redundant as the plaintiff’s Moroccan partner had been given refugee status while court proceedings were still underway and thus providing her with legal status to stay and allowing her to stay legally in Malta.

In addition, the plaintiff requested full care and custody rights, a monthly maintenance and the division of assets obtained after marriage. The defendant rejected responsibility for the failed marriage and the need for maintenance, while asking the court to share care and custody of their children. The couple, both Egyptian nationals, met in their home-country and had three children together, the first of which was born a year and a half after they started dating. The defendant travelled often to Malta due to work commitments and was very domineering while expecting the plaintiff to do exactly as he said. He sent money back home on a monthly basis but these were not sufficient to cover the costs and she had to resort to asking money from her family. The plaintiff would not see her husband for many months on end and whenever she offered to follow him to Malta he always refused. Her culture, she said, did not permit her to have other relationships or fall pregnant from another man and therefore she was forced to accept the situation for the family’s sake. There were also numerous instances she said, in which the defendant was violent towards her but she always ended up forgiving him. The plaintiff also blamed her family who would lock her up and shout at her when she showed interest in somebody else and pressured her to save her relationship with the defendant. After the Egyptian revolution of 2011 the couple got formally married and registered their union in Malta. Once in Malta, a woman would regularly come to their family home to cook and clean. After a while the plaintiff realised that this woman was in an intimate relationship with her husband. At this point, the violence increased and reached the epitome when one day he attacked her with a knife. Subsequently, the plaintiff left the household and contacted the police who issued a protection order in her favour. She spent two years raising her children in a shelter for the displaced and it was here that she gave birth to their third child. In the meantime, the defendant lost access to the children and at the date of sentencing had not seen his children for four years. The defendant missed most of the proceedings but refuted the claims that he was ever violent or had extra marital relations or that he did not provide adequate financial support to his family. The court found that the plaintiff had not been there for his wife and children right from the start, as opposed to the plaintiff who always did her utmost to raise her children. The court acceded the plaintiff’s request by granting personal separation together with full care and custody rights and a monthly maintenance. In addition, the court found that the home in which they resided in Malta, and in which the defendant currently lived, had been bought a few months after marriage even though the defendant had made it seem as though they were divorced.

The issue had revolved around the plaintiff importation of an energy drink by the name of Cocaine, produced by an American company Redux Beverages. The plaintiff had argued that it had obtained all permits and paid all the duties and custom fees necessary for the importation of the product and that the actions of the Customs Department blocking its distribution resulted in financial and reputational damages. The plaintiff had asked the court to order the release of the product and award its compensation for the damages sustained. The defendant had objected, claiming that it had acted in accordance to the public policy titled “National Drug Policy” published that same year by the government and which was designed to combat a culture of drug taking present among youths by blocking anything that placed drugs in good light. The appellant argued that energy drinks are popular mostly with youths, who not being in the legal age for alcohol consumption, resort to obtaining a “high” through theses energy drinks which contain an elevated amount of caffeine. Therefore, there was the risk that vulnerable and impressionable youths might equate the good sensation given by the energy drink with the name of Cocaine to the same imagined benefits of using the restricted drug by the same name. The Public Policy, the appellant continued, was far encompassing and applicable to all government entities. In addition, the appellant had claimed that the company registered the product as “Redux Energy Drink”, omitting the word “Cocaine” which was an integral part of the name in such that it is clearly visible on the product’s packaging. This constituted voluntary deception, thus rendering the importation process irregular. The lower court had found the Custom Department’ actions illegal, abusive and lacking legal basis. However it appealed arguing that the lower court had erroneously judged it to have acted abusively as it had acted in compliance with the Customs Ordinance in the Law of Malta and the rights it conferred on him as Director General. The Court of Appeal argued that if a product is not specifically prohibited in law, the same law does not give the appellant overarching power to confiscate a product only due to its name. This is because even though public policy aimed at reducing the culture of drug taking among youths can be observed as a concept of public order, a public policy does not have legal effect. Customary law is comparable to fiscal law in matter of interpretation and must be given a limited reach. It is not acceptable that the Director of Customs is given the right to arbitrarily decide what is to be considered as a danger to public order, as this would prejudice citizens and importer rights who have the right to know what is not permitted by law. The Court of Appeal noted how youths are constantly bombarded by marketing of various products, such as alcohol and cigarettes, that might be detrimental to their health but it is through intensive educational campaigns that this should be counteracted and not by the formation of a police state which controls the lives and inhibits the free will of individuals. The appellant, said the court, is not vested with the role of Censor, it did not have the right to approve trade or health licences and did not have the competences to enter into the merit of product names or their presentation, but instead was limited to act only if a product was of damage to health, and this was not the case for the matter at hand. The Court of Appeal felt certain of the appellant’s good faith but confirmed the lower courts sentence, ordering it to pay an even larger remuneration to the sum of €6250.92, with the court expenses being divided equally between the parties.",Maltese,

He claimed that as the biological father he possessed the right of parental authority. The Maltese plaintiff and German defendant had a relationship that lasted about four years. The relationship ended when the defendant left Malta with their two children and settled in her hometown, where the children by the time of sentencing had lived for nine years. The plaintiff lamented about the unlawful actions by the defendant who denied him parental rights by unilaterally deciding to leave for Germany. In addition, the defendant’s abduction of their children was hindering the plaintiff from establishing a healthy and meaningful relationship with his children. He claimed that this was detrimental to the minors who lost the opportunity of having a consistent father figure in their life. The defendant argued that the court did not have jurisdiction on the matter and said that the issue should be decided by the German courts. She justified her actions by saying that while she had supported the plaintiff for a long period of time, she was forced to escape the Island to safeguard the children from the plaintiff’s psychological unsuitability including impatience, irascibility, lack of self-control and instability, characterised by sudden flights of temper and sudden depressive mood-swings. The defendant also argued that she had to run away from the plaintiff’s anger and excessive drinking which led to her having an indescribable fear for the children and herself. The defendant described that contrary to the plaintiff, she has proven her consistency and loyalty to her children, even deciding to postpone her full-time employment in order to take better care of the children, raising them in a balanced, healthy environment. Their relocation to Malta, she claimed, would disturb the children’s content life and educational prospects in Germany. She added that she never objected or obstructed their father from visiting his children in the numerous occasion he flew to see them. She lamented that their elder son was showing signs of being confused in the present Maltese habitant while proceedings were underway and this had to do with the culture-shock and parental alienation, as the plaintiff spoke negatively about the defendant in front of the minors. Both parties requested the court to award them maintenance for raising the children. The court brushed aside the defendant’s claim that it did not have jurisdiction and stated that even though procedures to return the children to Malta according to the Convention of the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (1980) had failed or the procedures were withdrawn, it could not ignore the fact that the children had been unlawfully removed from Malta without the father’s consent. However, when considering the care and custody of the children, the court argued that it would focus only on the best interests of the minors. The court, while touting both parties as loving parents who went to great lengths to care and visit their children, scolded the parties for their actions towards each other, which only served to reduce the opinion the children had of the other parent and which did not aid in their development. The court did not doubt the suitability of either party in their role as parents and said that although each parent battled for sole care and custody of the children, it would not be in the minor’s best interest for this to happen and argued that it should be shared. Nevertheless, the court agreed that the minors were not to be uprooted from their stable life in Germany. Instead, the children would spend half of their school vacations with the plaintiff and would have unlimited and daily access to the children in the other periods of the year either through technological means or visits to the country. The court stressed how the minors were also Maltese nationals and should regularly visit the Island in order to be exposed to the Maltese culture and way of life. The court ordered both parties to pay maintenance to each other depending on whether the children at that moment in time lived in Germany or Malta.

She hated Maltese climate and food and was very frustrated by the fact that she could not find and buy the things she was used to having in her home-country. According to the plaintiff, his wife suffered from a sexual condition she had not been candid about prior to marrying. The marriage ended after eight months, when in a wedding reception the plaintiff left early while the defendant stayed there getting inebriated. She arrived later with the plaintiff’s parents who tried to accompany her but she violently resisted their grasp and later filed a report with police against them. Subsequently, she left from Malta and the plaintiff never saw or heard from her again. The plaintiff’s mother testified in the proceedings and similarly said that the defendant used to continuously complain about Malta and nothing seemed to suit her tastes. She had wanted to go to live with the plaintiff’s parents because she found his flat to be too claustrophobic. However she never helped around and even refused to have photos of her taken or to allow the couple’s parents to meet. The court said that the fact the parties married so quickly after first acquainting clearly indicated that the decision to marry had been taken arbitrarily, without any preparation, reflection or thought. The defendant did not even give herself time to get used to Maltese culture and as a result ended up criticizing everything. On the other hand, the plaintiff got married as a sort of personal challenge after ending another relationship just six months before and the fact that he kept working night shifts did not allow for the stabilisation of a healthy matrimonial relationship. The court argued the marriage celebration itself was given no importance because the couple did not grasp their obligations when they gave consent to marry. The court therefore acceded to plaintiff’s requests and granted the annulment of marriage, with court expenses to be borne by the defendant. The defendant did not take part in the proceedings.",Maltese,

The couple had met in Bulgaria, the country of origin of the defendant, at a time when the latter was studying nursing and the plaintiff had employed her as an interpreter. He fired her as she was inadequate for the job but felt pity for her when she came to him asking for money to have an abortion. They soon started a romantic relationship and the defendant fell pregnant a year after first meeting. The couple married a few weeks before the defendant gave birth. There was a twenty-year difference between both parties and the plaintiff stated that the defendant’s psychological difficulties commenced soon after marriage. Both parties accused each other of violence, including towards the child, infidelity, chronic debilitating pain which altered their mood and psychological disturbances. The plaintiff stated that he had always been the primary carer of their daughter while the defendant contributed little to her upbringing and spent very little time with her. He said that she was under investigation by the Maltese and Bulgarian authorities on suspicion of having falsified documents in order to be able to work as a nurse in Malta. In addition, he said that the defendant had started slapping the child from the age of six months and continued for a few years until he made it clear to her that even if it was part of Bulgarian and gypsy culture to do so, it was not acceptable in other societies. He recounted numerous instances of depression, self-harm and psychotic episodes, which the plaintiff claimed had a grave effect on their child, even more so because in some occasions they had required the assistance of the police. The defendant claimed to be the sole breadwinner of the family with her nursing job and that their child had been turned against her by her husband. She admitted to her extra marital relationships which served as an escape from the plaintiff’s violence and domineering attitude. Upon being interviewed by a phycologists and a children’s advocate, the daughter claimed to not wish to see her mother as she was often absent in her upbringing and her mother’s infidelity had caused her great sorrow. The court found that the marriage had collapsed primary due to the defendant’s infidelity and declared the separation while criticising both parties for using their child as a pawn against each other. The court decided that the child’s care and custody should be shared but temporarily awarded to the defendant because the plaintiff, to the court’s amazement, had left for England towards the end of proceedings and did not make it clear when he intended to return. It declared the community of acquests to be dissolved with maintenance to be awarded to the defendant should the plaintiff decide to remain in England.

The applicant based his claim on the fact that he could not return to Egypt due to fear for his life and a well-founded fear of being persecuted because of his religion if he were to return to Egypt. He had spent the previous eighteen years travelling between Egypt and Malta in connection to a business venture he shared with his brother which involved the importation of various goods from Egypt then sold on the Maltese islands. He was a Coptic Christian and claimed to have never experienced problems in Egypt except in his last trip when he was approached by ISIS or Muslim Brotherhood who told him that they did not appreciate Christians and the Cross. The appellant claimed he was threatened a handful of times in the six-week period he spent that time in Egypt and his children were mentioned in the conversations. He claimed to have reported the incidents to the police but was told that nothing could be done because he did not know their names and due to the sensitive political ties. The Refugee Appeals Board took into consideration interviews and the appeal application filed by the appellant and found inconsistencies in his statements. At first, he said that he had been approached in person but later declared that they had called him too. He also claimed to be worried for his family and yet he had a wife, children, and three siblings still living in Egypt, none of which ever encountered any problems. The Board further noted that while the plaintiff professed concern for his family’s safety, he had in actually fled on his own and abandoned them for a number of years. In addition, the plaintiff was deemed further unreliable when he claimed to have a Bachelor’s Degree in Business and yet when asked to name the capital of his home country he answered Alexandria. When asked if he could relocate away from the perceived danger the appellant answered in the negative, saying that neighbours could be ISIS members without him knowing it and at the same time failed to produce evidence of the police reports he said to have lodged with Egyptian authorities. The Board therefore found the applicant’s claims of well-founded fear for his life highly questionable, unreliable, not credible and lacking the necessary semblance of truth. It was of the opinion that the applicant’s sole preoccupation was to retain residency rights and continue operating his business in Malta, suspicion further confirmed by the fact that he only applied for asylum protection ten months after supposedly fleeing Egypt and only after his visa was not renewed. The Board continued that there was no evidence that the Egyptian state was unable or unwilling to provide him with the necessary legal protection and according to Malta, Egypt was considered a safe country. The Board approved the Refugee Commissioner’s conclusion that he was not eligible for refugee status or subsidiary protection and the applicant’s appeal was rejected.",English,NOT PUBLIC

The marriage had lasted four years during which period both parties agreed that it was a time characterised by constant fighting, mainly due to the cultural differences between them. The plaintiff arrived from a Muslim nation and she says that there used be great clashes regarding the defendant’s alcohol and pork consumption. She admits that having arrived from a different culture made her integration into society difficult and at the beginning she kept on living according to the culture and ideologies of her home country. In addition, by his own admission, defendant’s regular outings with his friends for long hours proved a further burden on the relationship. During the marriage there had been attempts at saving the union but the cultural differences ended up resulting too significant with the plaintiff stating that he could never lead the life the plaintiff wished for him. There were no assets to be divided and no need for maintenance, and the court granted the plaintiff’s request because it judged that there was no hope for reconciliation and the minimum four-year separation period required by Maltese law prior to divorcing had been reached.",Maltese,

The plaintiff, of dual American-Maltese citizenship, had sole care and custody of the eleven-year-old child which she had with the defendant and requested the court to allow her to spend around three years abroad in order to further her studies in the US. The defendant was not in favour of this decision and the first court had refused the request made by the mother after consulting with numerous experts including a child advocate and two phycologists, who found that the relocation of the child at this stage in the child’s life would not be in her best interest. The plaintiff appealed the decision on the basis that the judgement had been procedurally flawed, that not enough weight had been given to its own decision to grant her sole care and custody of the child, that the minor wishes expressed to the Children’s Advocate had been disregarded and that only “hypothetical negatives” had been listed in the experts’ report while disregarding the positives derived from such an experience. The appellant further argued that various technological means were available to facilitate contact with the father who had visitation rights and that exposure to a much wider culture would prove beneficial to the child by broadening her life experiences and getting to know part of her heritage. The Court of Appeal brushed aside the appellant’s procedural claims and said that care and custody is not necessarily related to the relocation issue, in the sense that the first does not necessarily comprise the second. Care and custody must not be looked upon as granting special rights to the custodial parent, but rather as placing greater responsibility on that parent to make decisions in the best interests of the child. The court-appointed experts had found that the child’s relocation and exposure to a much wider culture at this stage in her development would likely have a harmful effect on the child and indeed, such a radical change in her circumstances and in her social and educational environment may have a negative effect on her development. The court noted how the Children’s Advocate’s report had worked against the plaintiff and not in her favour as the expert had noted how the child was very attached to her maternal grandfather first and foremost, but also to her father and half siblings, and would not want to distance herself from them for a long period of time. In a second interview, the child, when given a choice by the Children’s Advocate, had said that she would prefer to leave with her mother then stay behind with her paternal grandfather, but his in the court’s opinion, only demonstrated the attachment she had with her mother but if she had to choose, she would still prefer to stay in Malta together with her mother. In addition, in the US. the plaintiff would have little support from family and friends. The court noted the situation might have been different had she been able to prove a network of support that she would have been able to rely on while abroad and which would have helped in the transition period and adaptation process for the child. The positives listed by the appellant to counter balance the hypothetical negatives mentioned in the report were nonetheless hypothetical, said the court. The Court of Appeal therefore rejected the appellant’s request and ordered her to bear the expenses incurred by the court.",English,

The plaintiff was the child of a Lebanese father and a Maltese mother and complained that he did not feel connected to Lebanese culture or identity. He claimed that during his childhood he was subjected to intense bullying because of his Arabic name. He developed a low self-esteem and a nervous tick which led him to start using the Western name, in addition to his mother’s maiden surname. He hid this fact from his father who was very strict on issues involving Muslim religion and culture, until his parents separated, at which point he started using his preferred name freely. The plaintiff provided copious documentation showing that he utilized the name Western name - rather than the Arabic name - in everyday life and was known as such since his childhood in personal circles, bank and academic institutions and on the work place. The only inconvenience and embarrassment arose when he presented official documentation such as his passport and identity card which retained the plaintiff’s given name. He felt he had arrived in a period in his life in which he started thinking about marriage and children and therefore asked the court to grant the name change to reduce confusion and conform his position. The defendant, represented by the Director of the Public Registry, said that there were two issues at hand: the request to change his name, and secondly, to change his surname. While the defendant left it up to the court to decide if the plaintiff had provided enough evidence to support his claim that he had been widely known for a long period of time by the Western name, he added that the law did not contemplate changes in surnames, except for circumstances in which errors had taken place. The court said that while it is true that the law did not contemplate changes in surname, it had come to be accepted that the courts should not apply the law with excessive rigor. Surname changes are subject to greater scrutiny than first names in order to protect the interests of third parties. The court however found that since the plaintiff had been known as such since his childhood, allowing this discrepancy to persist between his known name and his legal name would not be in the interest of third parties and the society as a whole. The plaintiff was already known by this name and altering his birth certificate would only mean regularizing his situation, which was in his as well as society’s best interest. The court concluded that the plaintiff had provided enough evidence to prove that he had repudiated his birth name for a number of years now and granted his request to change both name and surname, with court expenses to be borne by him.",Maltese,

The police also requested the court to provide protection order in favour of the victims. The prosecution recounted how the police received a call regarding a disturbance and upon hearing the complainants found out that the accused had randomly attacked two people while hurting a third who had intervened to help. The police restrained the defendant who was sent for psychiatric evaluation as he was judged to be acting erratically, possibly under the effects of drugs. Upon admission to hospital, the defendant said that he felt to be in the presence of Mohammed and God and the doctors found him to be psychotic, requiring long-term treatment. The prosecution asked the court to carry out a psychiatric evaluation of the defendant to determine if he was fit to stand trial. The defendant admitted to being at the location in question that night but did not remember acting violently or why he did so. He declared great regret for what he had done and said that he had never wished to hurt anybody. A psychiatrist court expert was put on the case who found the defendant to be very timid and polite and concluded that during the incident the defendant had suffered from acute mania. This mania, which seemed to have been an isolated incident, included religious delusions. In the period leading to the incident, the defendant had started fixating on religion and had started praying regularly. On the day, the defendant felt his heart racing, his head exploding and great excitement which he could not really explain, apart from the fact that he felt himself to be in the presence of God. The psychiatrist stated that one must keep in mind differing culture and religion when dealing with mania as these have an effect on the symptoms and their extent, explaining that mania in a Maltese man generally takes less than 45 days to resolve. The defendant was not taking his medications as he felt better, but since it had occurred once the expert said there was nothing stopping it from occurring again. The psychiatrist recommended keeping the defendant under supervision but admitted that it might have just been a one-time occurrence as often found in certain cultures. The court found that at the time of the incident the defendant lacked means rea, lacking the formulation of intention to commit the crimes he was accused of, and was not to be held responsible for his actions. The court exempted him from all criminal responsibility and did not find him guilty of the charges brought against him, but ordered him to be kept under supervision until three specialists present a report to the court declaring him fit for release.",Maltese,

The plaintiffs have temporary emphyteusis of a building in view of a contract signed on the 23rd of March 1876, which would expire in 2026. Since 1923 the building had been leased to the defendant band club dedicated to Stella Maris, for a yearly sum of 150 Maltese lira (349.41 Euros). The lease agreement bound the defendant to undertake ordinary maintenance works while barring the lessee from carrying out any structural works. The plaintiffs went in front of the Rent Regulation Board and later the Court of Appeal, to grant them the right to refuse renewing the lease agreement as the defendant had carried out extensive works without their prior consent. The Court of Appeal agreed with the plaintiffs’ claims but in the meantime, while the case was still pending, Article 1531J(5)of the Civil Code was introduced with retroactive effect which prohibited eviction from premises such as band clubs when the structural alterations consist of works related to the philharmonic or social and cultural activities of the band club, and which added that when the works consist of improvements to the premises and the band club provides a guarantee sufficient for the Courts that at the termination of the lease the lessee would make good for any loss suffered during the execution of the necessary works. The guarantee read the sub-article shall be established on the basis of the prices at the time of the judgement. The Court of Appeal referred the case to the constitutional court to determine if the retroactive nature of the aforementioned amendment had impinged upon the plaintiff’s right for a fair hearing as stipulated by Article 6 of Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and if they were not allowed peaceful enjoyment of their possessions as protected by Article 37 of the Constitution of Malta and Article 1 of the First Protocol of the European Convention on Human Rights. Consequently, the constitutional court was asked if article 1531J(5) of the Civil Code was to be applied to the case in question. The defendant included both the Band Club and the Attorney General who was defending the retroactive nature of the law by claiming that it did not disrupt the procedural guarantees or impinge on the plaintiffs’ rights. The law amendment was in the public interest to create a fair and equal balance between the interests of the landlords, band clubs and the general public. Thus the law was aimed to protect band clubs as Maltese cultural heritage. The band club stated that they were a non-governmental entity and that they used the building in question for various cultural services targeting local residents and the Maltese population as a whole. These included music lessons, band practice, local feast preparations, Christmas concerts, exhibition of the statues on Good Friday and children’s procession, in addition to serving as a meeting place primarily for the elderly with a bar and billiard tables available daily. The constitutional court said that while retroactive applications of law or amendments were not automatically precluded, this did not mean that the State had unlimited power to introduce legislation with retroactive validity and influencing pending court cases. For this to occur there must be a compelling public interest and it was not the case here. It was true that cultural heritage was in public interest and that the state should introduce legislation intended to protect it and it was equally undoubted that band clubs formed part of this cultural heritage, however this did not mean that the State should legislate in favour of said Band Clubs to the detriment of the citizens, as it is also in the public interest to ensure the principle of legal certainty is protected. The court therefore found the retroactive nature of the law impinged upon the plaintiff’s rights and judged that the Stella Marris Band Club should not benefit from the protection granted by Article 1531J(5)of the Civil Code.",Maltese,

The plaintiff explained how in Saudi Arabian culture every offspring took its father’s name as his second name and his paternal grandfather’s name as his third name. This meant that the plaintiff’s name was not that written in his Maltese documents. When the plaintiff obtained Maltese citizenship through the Malta Individual Investor Programme, his name was erroneously listed. The plaintiff presented numerous translations of official Saudi documents, including his identity card, passport, criminal record, marriage contract and Civil Status – Family Card, all of which showed his full name as he claimed in the present proceedings. The plaintiff therefore asked the court to order the defendant to make the necessary changes to his birth certificate, while including an annotation on the said document to account for the changes and the reasons why this occurred. The defendant responded that it was bound by law to include a person’s name to the registry as written on their birth certificate and noted how under the section “Information on the child” the listed name was indeed that established in the Maltese documents. The court was shown the legal opinion of a Saudi lawyer who said that even though in the section “Information on the child” the name listed was as such, this was not an error as Saudi law automatically incorporated a new-born’s father and paternal grandfather’s name into the child’s full name, as could be seen on the plaintiff’s subsequent identity card, passport and other official documentation. The court noted that even though no error had occurred on the defendant’s part, the plaintiff’s correct name, as indicated by various official documentation was that claimed by the plaintiff.

The plaintiff had married her present Italian husband in 1988 and immediately departed for Italy where she went by her maiden name, in conformity to Italian culture whereby women upon marriage do not take their husband surname but instead retain their own. She exhibited numerous official documents which showed her being referred to by her maiden surname, including her Italian identity card, driving licence and health insurance card. She provided additional documentation and affidavits which proved that she was commonly known as being her maiden surname and that it was the name she went by in her everyday life. The plaintiff argued that it was in her best interest to have congruence between her Maltese and Italian official documents. The Director of Public Registry acting as defendant in the case, objected to the request saying that Maltese law, while contemplating name changes, did not allow for changes in surnames expect for in cases in which errors had occurred. He continued by saying that while in 1988 it was not permitted for a woman to retain her maiden surname upon marriage, an amendment in 1993 had giving women who had married before that date, six months opportunity to alter their surnames. Therefore, the plaintiff had a window of opportunity to change her surname which had now passed and thus her choice of surname was now definitive. It was clear to the defendant that the plaintiff had wished to integrate into Italian culture by taking up their customs and introducing herself by her maiden surname, thus creating a double identity. The court felt that married women living in Malta in 1993 had a territorial advantage as opposed to expatriates when it came to keeping abreast with the latest laws introduced on the island. The 1993 amendment allowing for reversion to the maiden surname might easily have escaped the plaintiff’s attention, as the means of communication back then were less developed than in 2020. Nonetheless, her native country’s documentation listed her by a name that she did not use, that she did not identify with and which nobody knew her by. This allowed for confusion regarding the plaintiff’s surname, which is to the detriment of third parties as it would be of general interest for people to know the plaintiff’s exact name. It is indeed this uncertainty that the plaintiff wished to amend and if the court did not allow for the name change, it would not be doing its job in trying to alter the situation for the better. The court therefore granted the plaintiff’s request to revert to her maiden surname while requesting the defendant to carry out the necessary changes in the woman’s marriage certificate.",Maltese,

He requested these changes to be carried out in both his marriage certificates and his children’s birth certificates, as the perceived mistakes were reflected also on his wife and three children. The plaintiff, of Syrian origin, said that his surname as translated in the Maltese Registry did not match the way it was pronounced in his native country and the plaintiff produced numerous Arab friends and relatives who all confirmed that they referred to the plaintiff as such. The plaintiff brought to the stand even his daughter’s Arabic teacher to explain the difference between classical Arabic with spoken Arabic in Syria where the letter “g” is read as “c”. He continued that the family name was pronounced wrongly when spelled in English as “Frabag” and that the closest pronunciation to the Arabic alternative was “Frabatch”. The Director of Public Registry acting as defendant objected to the changes saying that the plaintiff’s names had been listed in the Public Registry as was written in the translation of his birth certificate. In these translations his surname was always that of “Frabag” and additionally, the Libyan passport he presented together with his Syrian birth certificate listed his name as stated by him. The defendant continued that while no error had been made by the Registry, it was also true that in Malta a name is written according to local alphabet and grammar and not based on how it is pronounced in Syria. There are many names written in a way and pronounced in another and said surnames should not be changed simply due to pronunciation differences in the country of origin. A court appointed expert in the matter of translation said that the most appropriate translation of the Arab surname “Frabag” to English would be “Frabaj”. In addition, if it were to be written in Maltese it would be “Frabaġ”, - with a dot on the g - even though in Malta name transcriptions are carried out using English alphabet and phonetics. She noted how Syrian Arabic was influenced by the period of French rule while in Libya they tended to follow English alphabet and phonetics, thus explaining the discrepancy between the plaintiff’s Syrian birth certificate and Libyan passports. She concluded that “Fratch”, while not being her preferred translation, might not be necessarily wrong due to the different factors that influence translations. The court agreed with the defendant in that there are numerous names that are pronounced differently from how they are written and gave the example of “Giullaumier” that is locally pronounced quite differently. It stressed how imperative it was to retain certainty and consistency in the public registry and a surname could not be changed just to reflect different phonetics, since the plaintiff’s surname had been correctly translated into English. The court was not certain that “Frabag” reflected an incorrect pronunciation of the surname, considering just how close it was to the transcription in Maltese and noted how the plaintiff’s Arab teacher had said that not even “Frabatch” was entirely satisfactory, but was in his opinion the closest. The court therefore rejected the plaintiff’s request to change his surname but however did note that the plaintiff’s name in his Syrian birth certificate was indeed as stated by him and thus ordered the defendant to carry out the necessary changes in this regard.

The couple, both Swedish nationals, had met during the Christmas period and started cohabitating within 45 days from meeting, a decision which the plaintiff later described as very immature as it had occurred too soon and even in that short period they had been living in different countries. The defendant proposed marriage six months into their courtship and married while both were working in Malta, a little more than a year after their first meeting. The plaintiff said that during their marriage they lived independently from each other, with different friends and outings and they never discussed each other’s businesses. Neither were children ever part of the conversation and they never got to discussing their future together. The plaintiff said that on hindsight they were more friends than lovers and they were fine for a short period of time because they kept themselves occupied leading separate lives. In fact, problems started emerging when they moved to Curacao because the plaintiff’s job had relocated there and the defendant failed to secure a job when there. This started causing friction and continuous arguments until finally the defendant left for his home country Sweden, at which point both parties came to the realisation that they did not wish this marriage anymore. The plaintiff’s lawyer said that in the parties’ culture the marriage bond is far less onerous than in Malta and this due to the fact that divorce proceedings have existed in their country for numerous generations, and involves much shorter timeframes than those required by Maltese Law. Marriage in Sweden is a bond that can be easily undone and the idea of permanence in marriage does not figure in Swedish culture, thus putting the couple’s hurried marriage into better context. The court noted how a defect of discretion of judgment is not just lack of thought or reflection and that the parties had failed to prove an ulterior motive that had led them to get married. Problems started emerging two years after marrying and only then did they realise that their decision was incorrect but that did not invalidate the consent given. The marriage’s failure could be easily traced to the defendant’s failure to find employment in Curacao and the parties did not provide sufficient evidence to recommend the annulment of their marriage.

He described the torment of being deported from the Netherlands and did not wish to suffer the same faith again. He would often times burst into tears while pleading with the plaintiff for them to get married in order for him to obtain freedom of movement and labour in Malta. They soon agreed to marry but while he was in the process of seeking to extent his visa, he was deported on the whim, something which he blamed on the plaintiff’s parents for, according to the defendant, having reported him to authorities.

The couple therefore married in Tunisia after four months from acquainting and without the presence of the plaintiff’s father after he had tried until the very end to discourage her from entering into this rushed marriage. After marrying, the plaintiff recounted a few cultural issues that arose which she had not been foreseen. While not opposing that their son be baptised, he demanded that he undergo circumcision, something the plaintiff fiercely opposed. In addition, she was under the impression that after the nuptials they would start going out in the evenings together but instead the defendant continued to go out with his male friends. Things quickly turned sour between the parties. The plaintiff argued the defendant became violent, disappeared for long periods of time and had numerous extra marital relationships. As time progressed, she discovered many things the defendant had knowingly hid from her including the fact that he had been imprisoned in England and had been married in the Netherlands to a woman 20 years his senior. The plaintiff’s parents confessed how they had tried to dissuade their daughter from going along with the marriage, primarily because being Arab he had a very different culture, religion and attitude to life and marriage. They described the plaintiff as being a naïve and fragile person, who had allowed herself to be manipulated and possessed by the defendant. The defendant negated that his consent hid ulterior motives and said that he had faced continuous opposition by the plaintiff’s family due to his race; a problem he believed was present all throughout Maltese society where people would not call you by name but simply as “the Arab”. He also rejected the notion that he was ever violent or unfaithful, dismissing them as plaintiff’s fantasies. The court explained how consent by two persons in marriage requires a willing bond of two persons who wish to dedicate their lives to each other, while being well aware of the commitments this entailed. Consent needs to be given freely; free of any other considerations and if this consent is given without the complete knowledge of what is required in marriage, it then raises questions about the validity of marriage itself. The court concluded that it was clear that this was a case of marriage of convenience since the only issue motivating the defendant was his risk of deportation. This meant that consent was simulated and had the defendant’s legal status been regularised the parties would not have gone along with the marriage. The court therefore acceded to the plaintiff’s request and declared the marriage null, with court expenses divided between the parties.",Maltese,

The plaintiff recounted how she had met the Libyan defendant in a nightclub and they soon started cohabitating. The plaintiff’s parents did not agree with their relationship and she therefore had to leave the family household and started renting an apartment. Even though the agreement had been that the financial burden should be divided equally between them, it was almost always the plaintiff that ended up paying both their rent share and even after marrying the defendant never had a fixed job and yet the little money he had, he would send back to his mother in Libya. The couple married after a courtship of five months and even the marriage preparations and reception were entirely paid by the plaintiff and her parents, with no attendees from the defendant’s side of the family. The couple eventually decided to buy a place of their own but even in this instance the plaintiff ended up paying the loan, with her parents financing a few of the furnishings. The defendant did not even have money for a van he needed to buy for work purposes and asked the plaintiff’s parents for a loan, a loan which the plaintiff herself ended up paying back in part. The plaintiff said that often times the defendant would sleep on the couch and sometimes he would not sleep at home at all. They rarely went out as a couple because he preferred the company of his friends. He would invite his friends to their house and they would eat on the floor, as they were culturally accustomed to doing, leaving a mess for the plaintiff to clean up. The plaintiff said that after only a fortnight had passed from their marriage ceremony, the defendant started acting violently. He beat her with a broom stick and dragged her from her hair when she told him to clean after himself. Another time, recounted the plaintiff, he had beaten her with an electrical wire, causing her injuries to her back. The beatings remained constant. She said she was terrified of him and she did not have anywhere to hide from him due to the fact they did not have doors in their home. She found him so intimidating that she even agreed to fund a high-up van he wanted for his job, a vehicle which costs several tens of thousands of euros. A few weeks after obtaining citizenship he called the plaintiff to tell her that he was leaving to never return again. He sold the high-up his wife had financed, kept the money and left for his home-country. The plaintiff’s parents gave witness and said that they had not liked the idea of her dating an Arab and warned her to be wary of him. The father said that marriage in the defendant’s culture and tradition meant that the women was a slave to the husband and not an equal companion. Both parents confirmed the defendant’s violent nature and recounted the first time the plaintiff had gone crying to them, just two weeks after marrying. The court found that the requirements for the separation of a married couple had been met, including confirmation of the violence sustained by the plaintiff and the defendant’s abandonment of the family home without a valid reason. The court accepted the plaintiff’s requests, granted the personal separation from the defendant and awarded her the right to all marital assets.

The plaintiff explained that his son was born in Tripoli, Libya and his birth certificate was subsequently registered with the Director of Public Registry, defendant in the case. The defendant had been presented with a translation of the child’s Libyan birth certificate but, due to an error in translation, the name had been written wrongly. In addition, the plaintiff’s surname, as father of the offspring, had been written also differently and the child’s month of birth listed as “June” instead of “January”. The plaintiff presented the court with an updated translation of the original documentation and said that it was in the minor’s best interests for the changes to occur because his passport was being issued with the erroneous data and causing numerous difficulties. The defendant said that it was legally bound to input the information in the registry ad verbatim based on a translation provided by the plaintiff and therefore no error had been committed on his part. The defendant advised the court to appoint an expert to provide an objective translation of the Libyan birth certificate. The court did exactly that and enlisted the help of an expert translator of Arabic to English who agreed with the plaintiff in that the plaintiff’s correct full name and surname, and born in the month of “January”.

The expert explained that transliteration is unfortunately very subjective as there is no translation manual as to how to translate names and more than one version of the same name would be correct. The expert added that it also makes a difference if the name is being transliterated into Maltese or into English. The expert maintained that as a general principle the translation made in the country of origin shall be the accepted translation since it would be the version of the name registered in the birth country. The expert analysed the certificate used by Maltese authorities to register the child and noticed there were several errors, specifically in the date of birth, the name of the minor and the father’s name. The expert explained that classical Arabic only uses three vowels and explained the sounds of these vowels had they to be translated into Maltese characters.

The court heard how the plaintiff, a Libyan national, had been jailed in a military camp in Tripoli for having escaped from his job as an aeroplane mechanic in the same military camp. He spent three months imprisoned, during which period he was beaten and tortured. A few years later he was arrested again due his association with the opposition party, the Libyan National Front for the Salvation of Libya. Conditions were poor and he spent nine months imprisoned at which point his passport and identity cards were confiscated. He fled for Malta using his brother’s passport and spent two and a half years on the island and had a son with a Maltese woman, before being arrested and deported. A few years later he tried his luck again, this time using his nephew’s passport and once on the Maltese islands he sought to apply for asylum. While the application was accepted by the Refugee Commissioner, his claim was eventually rejected. The plaintiff appealed his case in front of the Refugee Appeals Board but the board did not even consider his appeal, telling the appellant that he had applied for asylum after the sixty day period upon arrival to Malta, as per the law at the time. The plaintiff instituted legal proceedings on the basis that the Refugee Commissioner had the right to accept late applications in exceptional circumstances and once the application had been accepted by the aforementioned authority, the Refugee Appeals Board did not have the right to reject it on the basis of prescription. The appellant therefore requested the Court of Appeal to nullify the decision by the Refugee Appeals Boards and ordered it to hear his case based on the merit. The defendant represented by the Refugee Appeals Board, the Police Commissioner in view of his role as Principal Immigration Officer and the Attorney General in name of The Government of Malta, brushed aside the appellant’s claim saying that the Refugee Appeals Board decision was final and not appealable and that they had acted within the remit of the law. The lower court agreed with the defence and rejected the plaintiff’s claim. The Court of Appeal however found issue with this position saying that the Board did not in actual fact follow the Commissioner’s recommendation which albeit later rejecting his claim, had accepted the plaintiff’s application. By refusing to even hear the appeal, argued the court, the Board was going against the Commissioner’s decision to at least accept the application. It was therefore up to the discretion of the Commissioner to decide if a late application were to be accepted or not, and the Board should not delve into the application’s validity. Although it was true that the Board’s decision was not appealable, said the court, no law could ever exclude judicial review from occurring because it was not acceptable for an entity to take a decision which went against the law itself or principles of natural justice.

The court heard how the plaintiff, a Congolese national from the Democratic Republic of Congo, had had been an active member of the Movement Populaire de la Revolution (MPR) and had worked closely with Mobutu’s government while serving as a civil guard. Fearing persecution following Mubutu’s fall, the plaintiff fled to Nigeria where he applied and obtained refugee status. However, he then escaped Nigeria because he felt threatened due to the presence of Congolese security officials and travelled to Libya where he sought protection with the UNHCR. Once again he received refugee status in Libya but still he felt that he was in danger claiming that Libya did not differentiate between irregular migrants and refugees. He fled to Malta and entered the country irregularly where he immediately applied for asylum. The application was accepted by the Refugee Commissioner but his claim was eventually rejected as he had failed to prove that he had worked with the Mobutu regime. The plaintiff appealed his case in front of the Refugee Appeals Board but the board did not even consider his appeal, telling the appellant that he had applied for asylum in Nigeria first and later Libya and should therefore seek refuge in these countries. The plaintiff instituted legal proceedings on the basis that only the Refugee Commissioner had the right to accept or refuse applications and once the application had been accepted by the aforementioned authority, the Refugee Appeals Board did not have the right to reject it. The appellant therefore requested the Court of Appeal to nullify the decision by board and order it to hear his case on its merits. The defendants, represented by the Refugee Appeals Board, the Attorney General and the Refugee Commissioner, claimed that the Refugee Appeals Board decision was final and not appealable and that they had acted within the remit of the law. They said that this was a case of “asylum shopping”; a practice whereby a person applies for protection in as many countries as possible, a practice which is universally condemned and frowned upon, they said. The lower court had rejected the appellant’s claim agreeing that the Board had every right to make those considerations even if they had not occurred before the commencement of the case and that the Board’s final decision must be respected. The Court of Appeal however found issue with this position saying that after having read the law governing the Board’s modus operandi it disagreed that they had that right. By refusing to even hear the appeal, the Board was going against the Commissioner’s decision to accept the application. It was entirely up to the discretion of the Commissioner to decide if an application were to be accepted or not, and the Board should not have taken it upon itself to decide upon the validity of the application. Although it was true that the Board’s decision was not appealable, said the Court of Appeal, no law could ever exclude judicial review from occurring especially when decisions are deemed to go against the law itself or principles of natural justice.

The defendant described the defendant as an aggressive and violent person battling drug addiction who had numerous pending court cases involving drug possession, stalking and domestic violence amongst others. The couple had met while the defendant was in prison and married a short while later in Malta’s only mosque. The plaintiff described their relationship during this period as normal and she fell pregnant a few weeks after marrying. However, the defendant’s drug and drinking problems soon started emerging and a few months into the pregnancy the defendant was incarcerated for four years on drug and other charges and their child spend the first years of her life not knowing her father. When he was released the plaintiff noted changes in his personality finding him possessive, paranoid and aggressive and the relationship took a hit. The plaintiff recounted numerous instances of domestic abuse. On one occasion, when the defendant had wished to leave early from a family party, the defendant started pulling the plaintiff’s hair and punching her only stopping because her cousin and teenage daughter from a previous relationship restrained him. On another occasion, the defendant had been granted court bail on the condition that he followed a rehabilitation programme to help his drug addiction and after poor compliance on his part, it was the case workers who advised the plaintiff to end the relationship. When she ended the relationship, the defendant became increasingly erratic and possessive and numerous were the instances when she had to report him to the police. The defendant would stalk her and sleep in his car outside the plaintiff’s house causing her to live in constant fear. The last straw was when the defendant, a mechanic by profession, had called her to tell her that he had intentionally sabotaged her car. At that point, after a year and a half of abuse, the plaintiff left the matrimonial house and sought refuge at a shelter together with her daughter and only returned when the defendant had been imprisoned once again. The defendant spent the entire duration of the court proceedings regarding child custody in prison and he refused all opportunity to give his version of events. The plaintiff said that the defendant did not have any relationship with the child and in the past had shown himself to be an irresponsible parent. A representative of the organization entrusted with the duty of helping him with his drug addiction told the court that the defendant tried his best to overcome the dependency but struggled especially because of the difference in culture. The court started by saying that under normal circumstances both parents should have an important role in the life and upbringing of their children and no parent should be excluded from this process unless there were grave reasons to do so. The court determined that it in the present case there was ample evidence that it was in the child’s best interest to accede to the plaintiff’s request for exclusive parental authority and ordered the defendant to pay a maintenance of 400 euros a month. The maintenance was to commence a month after his release from prison with court expenses borne entirely by the defendant.",Maltese,

The appellant had fled his home country of Gambia to escape the threats of his own father given that the appellant was against the practice of female circumcision. He lived with his parents and three of his sisters and opposed to his father wish to have his two daughters’ perform female genital mutilation (FGM). The appellant tried his best to explain the negative consequences FGM and his father threatened to kill him. He therefore took his sisters with him and took them to live with his brother. The plan had been to escape the country altogether but realized that he did not have the financial means and therefore fled on his own, leaving his sisters behind with his brother. He passed through Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger and Libya, from where he departed for Malta. The Board detailed the applicable laws and subsequently studied the appellant’s home country Human Rights report of 2013. The report found that while Gambia was a multi-party democratic republic and held regular peaceful orderly elections, the country lacked rule of law and the elections were neither free nor fair. Government intervention in the electoral process and intimidation of opponents were common occurrences, in addition to harassment and abuse of its critics, torture, arbitrary detention and sometimes enforced disappearance of citizens. Other reported human rights abuses included denial of due process, restrictions on free speech, press and assembly, violence against women and girls including FGM, human trafficking, child labour and prostitution and discrimination against LGBT. Gambian law did not prohibit FGM and even though various campaigns were carried out to outlaw the practice, it remained a prominent feature among seven out of the present nine major ethic groups. After consideration of the appellant’s background, immigration history and evidence presented, the Board concluded that the appellant was not at risk of having female circumcision done on him as the persons at risk were his sisters and these were left behind. The Board did not feel that the appellant faced a well-founded fear of persecution according to the 1951 Conventions and therefore dismissed his appeal and claim for refugee status.",English,NOT PUBLIC

In addition, she requested the exclusive care and custody of the children, the liquidation of the community of acquests as well as the stipulation of a maintenance sum for her and their four children. The marriage between the Libyan defendant and the Syrian plaintiff had occurred in the latter’s home country and lasted some eight years; a marriage which according to the plaintiff had been marred by beatings, abuse, violence, excesses, threats, cruelty and grievous offences. She described her husband as being very controlling and physically, emotionally and sexually violent, problems exacerbated by an alcohol and drug dependence. The couple had been introduced to each other by their respective families and married after a courtship of about a year even though the defendant had previously spent some time incarcerated. The couple had relocated to Malta in order for the defendant to seek employment. However, in Malta, said the plaintiff, she found herself alone, abused by her husband and with no relatives to lean on. She would often be forced to abandon the family residence and seek refuge with the defendant’s brother, albeit often returning to her husband. The domestic violence however never stopped and the plaintiff recounted that he would even lock her and her children in a room while he consumed drugs with his friends. The plaintiff recounted numerous instances of abuse, for example when he forced himself upon her. Another time he tried to suffocate her with a pillow and when she was in hospital for their fourth child, she had left the other children with the defendant, only to return home and find them dirty and the place in disarray. The plaintiff further complained that the defendant did not provide any financial support to her and the children, on the contrary, he would often take the children’s allowance for himself and spend them on his vices. She was eventually forced to leave the matrimonial home for good and together with their children sought refuge in a shelter. The plaintiff had obtained an Order of Protection against her husband and lived in fear that he would discover her current residence. Social workers took to the stand saying that out of the four children, two were afraid of their father. Their father failed to attend the meetings to see his children and the court advised to stop them altogether. The court was also informed of the defendant’s numerous brushes with the law, including proceedings for possession of cannabis, threatening and insulting the plaintiff and making bomb threats to the Court. The defendant agreed with the request for separation but disputed the motivations given by the plaintiff and claims for maintenance. He told the court that their relationship had been difficult because the plaintiff had found it hard to adapt to the Maltese culture and he cared for his family because his wife had a very poor level of education. The court declared that it believed the plaintiff’s version of events and that there was plenty of corroborating evidence to support the claim that the defendant was violent and previous court judgements proved that he also had a drug dependency. The court declared that the marriage failed entirely due to the defendant’s actions and ordered the liquidation of the community of acquests. The court granted care and custody and residence of the children to the plaintiff and suspended all access rights for the defendant. In addition, it said that while records showed that the latter was not currently employed, this was not a sufficient excuse for not providing maintenance and ordered the defendant to pay 800 euros a month for the children and 250 euro maintenance to his wife.

The police had arrested a number of youths at a playing field - one of which was the defendant - who were caught smoking cannabis and in the accused’s car the police found pieces of the illicit drug. The defendant had admitted to the charges brought against him and the court learned that it had been a case of drug sharing in which the defendant had bought the drugs and shared the joint with his friend who in turn paid the defendant a small sum. The lower court was of the opinion that it was a case of drug trafficking because upon payment the joint, in legal terms of purchase and sell, was no longer property of the defendant. The court had therefore imposed the maximum penalty and ordered the drugs and all paraphernalia to be destroyed. The defendant appealed saying that while he confirmed his guilty plea, the sentence imposed had been far too harsh and thus unjust. While admitting to the grave mistake of consuming illicit drugs, the defendant said that the court had made an improper evaluation of evidence when it failed to fully comprehend the concept of drug sharing. The culture of drug sharing meant that the rolled cannabis cigarette was of the entire group in equal measure but in order for this to happen somebody needed to buy the drug to start with, explained the defendant. The derisory sum of 1 Maltese Lira (2.33 euros) paid by the appellant’s friends was not comparable to Civil Code regulations regarding transactions but should be seen as a sharing of expenses. The friends were all on equal footing and when taking into consideration the trivial quantity of cannabis involved, the fact that he was nineteen years old at the time, the fact that proceedings dragged on eight years with the appellant having a clean conduct and stable family life, the sentence imposed had been far too severe. The Court of Appeal started off by saying that the accused’s guilty plea and that of the prime witness had been taken by police without the presence of a lawyer and jurisprudence required that these get expunged from the record. In addition, there was no proof or expert report concluding that the substance found on the defendant was indeed an illicit drug, much less had the value of said substance been determined. The Court of Appeal agreed with the appellant in that in this case the concept of sharing applied which carried radical changes in the application of the sentence, meaning that he should benefit from the most favourable penalty rather than the harshest. It also took into consideration the defendant’s good track record and family life and acceded to his appeal by liberating him on the condition that he did not commit another crime for two years.",Maltese,

The Tribunal said that it was only an attempted marriage because the plaintiff’s wife was still lawfully married and the Judicial Vicar applied the terms of Canon law 1686 and declared the marriage null. The Marriage Act of the Laws of Malta allows for annulments of Catholic marriages handed down by ecclesiastical tribunals to have civil effect, as long as the decision adheres to a number of prerequisites. One of these criteria stipulated that for the courts to recognise the annulment it must be proven that during the proceedings before the Tribunal there was assured to the parties the right of action and defence in accordance to the principles of the Constitution of Malta. The court noted that among these principles is the right to a fair trial and in the eventuality that a party is absent during the proceedings, it must be ensured that the latter party’s interests are still adequately represented. This was the minimum requirement to ensure that a person absent from Malta, who could not be notified of court proceedings, is still given a fair hearing. In the case at hand, the defendant could not be notified and the Tribunal did not seem to have taken any measure in this sense. The court emphasised that this was not a criticism directed towards Canon Law or the procedure followed by the Tribunal but a simple observation that civil law requirements differed from religious ones. The Tribunal’s actions were perfectly legitimate and ritual for what is expected by Canon Law but this did not minimise the need for the Court to ensure that the principles mentioned in Law are adhered to. The court did not agree with the plaintiff’s argument that the ‘Defender of the Bond’ that is part of the proceedings before an ecclesiastical tribunal had represented the interests of the defendant; not only because it was a role meant to protect public and not private interest, but also because in this case the Defender agreed with all the plaintiff’s arguments without raising any other arguments. It was entirely irrelevant that both the defendant and the Director of Public Registry had not objected to the marriage being declared null by the court. The court quoted a sentence handed down by the British House of Lords which read that if principles of natural justice are violated in respect of any decision it must be declared to be no decision. The court extended this to the ecclesiastical tribunals and declared that its decision did not meet the requirements necessary for it to be registered and thus rejected the plaintiff’s request.",Maltese,

The elderly plaintiff had been walking under the archways at the entrance to the Maltese Capital City of Valletta when she had fallen on her face causing her to be hospitalised for a number of weeks and subsequently received round the clock care at a private facility. The plaintiff requested damages in order to cover the treatment and care costs in addition to ophthalmic consultations and the acquisition of a new pair of spectacles she required. The incident had occurred during the preparations for the annual Carnival festival traditionally held at the city’s entrance and which included numerous artistic performances and costume displays. The preparations included a seating area and barriers surrounding the enclosure which were carried out by the defendant company. The Assistant Cultural organiser within the Malta Council for Culture and Art confirmed that they had issued a tender for the assembly and disassembly of the stands used during the Carnival cultural activities which were held at a national level in Valletta’s Freedom Square. The defendant company rejected the claims saying that they were baseless in fact and in law because the works had been carried out with skill and diligence and it was therefore not responsible for the accident. The area in question had been cordoned off and they were not to be held responsible if the plaintiff had disregarded the instructions by adventuring in an area that was off-limits. In addition, the defendant said that it was the plaintiff’s responsibility to prove that the defendant had been responsible for the area in question and that at the time the enclosure had included other workers in sound and lighting with no links to the defendant company. The tribunal noted that the materials utilised by the defendant company included metal and plastic as well as wooden boarding, similar to that described by the plaintiff, which were used as the flooring of the stands. The contract showed that the defendant had been indeed responsible for works carried out in the vicinity of the area under examination and it was plausible that the wooden board formed part of the defendant’s assembly components. The Tribunal therefore concluded that on a basis of balance of probability the plaintiff had succeeded in proving her case against the defendant company who was guilty of carelessly and recklessly endangering her well-being. The Tribunal ordered the defendant company to pay damages and also all expenses related to the present proceedings.",Maltese,

He had been working as a nurse with the Department of Health when he got transferred to the Department of Culture where he informally performed the work of an Assistant Cultural Organiser. However, years later the Department sought to regularise the job by officially creating the position of Assistant Cultural Organiser and this required them to carry out a formal process of selection. This process was carried out by the Public Service Commission which had reviewed and interviewed the applicants for the position and presented the defendant Director of Culture with a list of candidates in order of preference. The plaintiff had classified him in the twelfth position meaning that he missed out on the vacancy but his knowledge and experience in the sector vastly surpassed that of the persons who were eventually employed. The plaintiff had great experience in the musical and cultural scenes, boasting a nomination as conductor of the national brass band and a seat on numerous organizational committees at the Malta Song for Europe (an annual song festival whose winner represents Malta at the Eurovision Song Contest). The plaintiff therefore asked the court to recognise this injustice by granting him the position with retroactive effect or alternatively by awarding him monetary damages in the region of 5,000 Maltese lira (€11,646.84). The plaintiff presented numerous witness accounts of previous employers all of whom confirmed that he had vast capacity and efficiency especially in the area of musical expertise, meaning that they would often leave everything in his hands in regards to the organization of orchestras held every few weeks during the summer period. The founder of the Department of Culture and previous employer of the plaintiff took the stand saying that it was he who had stipulated the appointment criteria and he did not have any doubt that the plaintiff was more qualified and had more experience than the persons who were actually chosen. The defendant rebutted the claims saying that a call for applications has been issued as required by law and the candidates had been chosen by the Public Service Commission. This meant that once he received the classification in which the plaintiff was twelfth preference, he had no other option but to employ the candidates favoured by the Commission. The Tribunal started off by saying that it was not the defendant who had excluded the plaintiff but the selection process had been carried out by the Public Service Commission, which in turn was protected by the Constitution of Malta. Therefore, these proceedings could never examine whether the Commission had validly carried out the functions entrusted to it by the Constitution and the Tribunal would never have the audacity to judge that a nomination or promotion awarded by the Commission was in any way invalid. This, however, did not mean that said nomination or promotion could not have unjustly affected a third party and it was the Tribunal’s duty to investigate such claims. There could be no doubt that the plaintiff was very qualified in the area of music and culture and would have been deserving of the job, said the Tribunal. It noted that the defendant had disputed his role in the alleged injustice as he did not oversee the selection process, limiting himself to employ the best candidates chosen by the Commission. In this regard the Tribunal explained that the defendant was not appearing on a personal basis but in representation of the Government as Head of the Department in question, as required by law. The Tribunal declared itself satisfied that the plaintiff had indeed suffered an injustice when he was overstepped for the vacancy of Assistant Cultural Organiser and advised the defendant Director to employ him to the position or else a compensate him to the sum of 3,000 Maltese lira (€6,988.13).

The plaintiff provided numerous documents including his old and present Syrian passport, his Syrian identity card, the identity card issued by the Refugee Commissioner, his residency permit issued by Identity Malta, his family book and marriage certificate, which all listed him as a Syrian national. Indeed, the plaintiff’s two other younger daughters were surnamed accordingly on their birth certificate and the plaintiff produced a number of witness accounts all of which confirmed that his eldest daughter was known by the same surname. The plaintiff argued that it was in everyone’s interest that her birth certificate reflected her real name and the one with which she is known. The Director of Public Registry acting as defendant, objected to the changes saying that Maltese law did not allow for alterations in surnames except for cases which involved mistakes. The defendant produced the plaintiff’s Italian passport and his wife’s Indonesian passport in which both listed the plaintiff as that stated by Maltese authorities and born in Iraq. Additionally, both parents had signed the Declaration for Notification of Birth in which both confirmed that the plaintiff was surnamed as such and that this same surname should be passed on to the child. The defendant lamented that this case was worrying in that the plaintiff upon birth of their daughter, had presented information that that did not correspond to the information and documents shown before this court. The plaintiff explained that upon landing in Italy after having fled his home country by boat via Libya, he had provided incorrect information to the Italian authorities in order to obtain refugee status. He had travelled to Malta with his Italian passport and when his daughter was born, he was still undergoing the process to obtain refugee status in Malta, this time with his correct information, as in the meantime war had broken out in Syria. The plaintiff therefore registered his eldest daughter with his incorrect surname whilst his younger daughters had been given the plaintiff’s real surname because by then his asylum request had been accepted. The court charged a court expert with the duty to translate his documents and she confirmed that the plaintiff’s name was without any doubt the name stated by him. The court said that while it was true that the law did not allow for changes in surnames it might be the case that it is in the general public’s interests for the changes to occur. In this case, it was unconscionable that one child had a name that differed from that of her siblings and this situation left as it is, would be detrimental not only to the society as a whole but would also expose the child to bullying and confusion. The court therefore granted the plaintiff’s requests, with court expenses to be borne by the plaintiff.",Maltese,

The plaintiffs, Malian and Ethiopian nationals, had entered the country irregularly and applied for refugee protection. They all professed to be minors and were therefore evaluated by the specifically established team within the defendant Agency in order to ascertain their age in order to differentiate between adult asylum seekers and unaccompanied minors. The plaintiffs received a letter which informed them that following an oral interview, the team had concluded that they had attained the age of majority and were not considered minors. Upon receiving the Agency’s decision, the four plaintiffs succeeded in obtaining documentation which proved their declared age but when they provided the said documents to the defendant Agency, they responded that they could not alter their decision and invited the plaintiffs to submit an appeal before the Immigration Appeals Board. However, by the time the applicants were invited to submit their appeal, the two-month appeal period had already expired. The plaintiffs claimed that the defendants were duty bound to motivate their refusals and had to clearly point out the procedure that the applicants had to adopt, while informing them of their right to appeal. The law, the plaintiffs continued, gave no hint of the right of appeal or the methodology used by the age assessment team, thus raising concern about the possibility of abuse of discretion. Unaccompanied minors were a particularly vulnerable group of people, they claimed, who should not be kept in detention and the plaintiffs said that it was not possible to determine the age of a person from a simple interview. The plaintiff’s request for asylum were subsequently refused both by the Refugee Commissioner and by the Refugee Appeals Board. In addition to requesting the revocation of the age assessment team, the plaintiffs requested that the court orders the Minister of Interior to release them from detention and enact new rules and procedures to effectively test and determine the age of asylum seekers, thereby guaranteeing the proper running of administrative procedures. The plaintiffs also asked for damages for the injustices sustained. The defendants, represented also by The Minister for the Interior and Parliamentary Affairs as the Minister responsible for Immigration and the Attorney General, argued that it was the applicant’s duty to provide concrete and credible proof on their age and that the interviews carried out were fair and in accordance to common standards and practices used throughout the European Union. The defendants said that the Agency observes the rules of proper administration and principles of natural justice. They said that no law, subsidiary legislation or UN Convention on the Rights of the Child were infringed upon and that the court did not have the right to issue orders to the Minister of the Interior as the requested by the plaintiffs. The court found that the documents that the plaintiffs said attested to their age – such as a birth certificate issued by the Orthodox Church of Tewahido in Ethopia - were not duly authenticated and did not satisfy the standards necessary for them to be considered documented proof. The panel that carried out the interviews had correctly followed the procedure of asking a pre-established set of questions with the assistance of an interpreter, although the interpreter did not seem a professional in this field. The plaintiffs had felt aggrieved by the fact that the decisions had been handed to them in a letter, written in a language they did not understand. This was a delicate issue that the court believed further underlined the cultural divide that existed between applicants and the institutions that necessitated fine-tuning. The court noted how the panel had listed a number of observations that served to justify their final decisions and these included: clean-shaven face, shaved head, white-haired individuals, mature responses and inconsistencies in their answers. The court rejected the plaintiff’s claim that they had not been aware of their rights as the plaintiffs had benefitted from the assistance of a local and vastly experienced non-governmental organization. The court concluded that such proceedings were administrative and not judicial in nature and were therefore the Agency was not legally bound to motivate its decisions. The court dismissed all of the plaintiff’s requests and ordered them to bear all court expenses.",English,

The incident occurred during the summer months when the plaintiff was out jogging with a friend. The plaintiff said that they needed to cross the road and jogged on the spot while checking one side of the road to see if it was clear. After determining that it was safe to traverse, the plaintiff started jogging across the road but they noticed the defendant’s vehicle arriving from the opposite direction and stopped near the middle of the road, while jogging on the spot. The plaintiff recounts that he was preoccupied when he saw the defendant’s car moving erratically and decided to go back from where he had initially crossed. He was hit by the defendant’s car and needed to undergo numerous orthopaedic surgeries. The plaintiff requested the court to declare the defendant solely responsible for the accident while stipulating an adequate remuneration for the damages sustained. The defendant rebutted that when he saw the plaintiff in the middle of the road, he crossed to the opposite lane to allow ample space between him and the jogger but it was at that moment that the plaintiff decided to turn back, straight into the car’s path. The defendant retorted that the accident was therefore solely attributable to the plaintiff and was thus due no remuneration. Three orthopaedic surgeons who had examined and operated on the plaintiff concluded that he had suffered a 10% permanent disability resulting from the accident. A court-appointed road expert said that the site of the accident was located a short distance from a pedestrian crossing. The expert lamented that the idea of walking a short distance more in order to traverse the road safely from a pedestrian crossing had not yet taken root in Maltese culture. This was a reality that drivers faced on a daily basis and the expert emphasized that the road must be shared between cars and pedestrians, meaning that even the pedestrians had duties of their own. He concluded that in this case the two parties seemed to have confused each other and were both to be held at fault in equal measure. The court agreed with the expert’s findings and said that while the plaintiff should have ensured before crossing that the road was clear from both directions so as not to stop in the middle of the road, the defendant should have slowed down upon seeing the plaintiffs, so as to better manage the situation. In regards to the compensation due, the court based its calculation on an annual income of 10,000 Maltese lira (€23293.79) multiplied by the nineteen years the plaintiff had left in order to reach retirement age, multiplied by 10% which was the amount of permanent disability sustained and divided in half since both shared the blame in equal measure (10,000 x 19 x 10% x 50% = Lm9,500 [€22,129.10]). A further 2% was deducted from the compensation sum in order to allow for lump sum payment. Court expenses were to be divided between the parties.",Maltese,

They had pleaded guilty to conspiracy, importation and possession of heroin with intent to supply, after they had been caught entering Malta with ingested capsules filled with the drug, in violation of the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, Chapter 101 of the laws of Malta. The defendants had argued that they were deserving of the maximum clemency when taking into consideration that they had made early pleas of guilt; had an otherwise clean criminal conducts in both Malta and Turkey; they had cooperated with police by revealing the identity of their suppliers and receivers; the suffering of being imprisoned in a foreign country with a different culture and language was of a greater nature than if they were imprisoned in their home country; they were victims themselves having been pressured into carrying out the act by ingesting the substances, thus putting themselves in danger; they were single mothers who acted out of severe financial difficulties; they had apologised to the Maltese society as a whole; their arrest had allowed authorities to uncover the whole drug smuggling ring with their contribution being key; and their conduct while imprisoned had been exemplary. The first court counterargued that the defendants should not frame their capture as a ‘blessing in disguise’ because it was the second time that they had imported illicit substances and probably would have continued if they had not been apprehended. In addition, the court said that if they felt pressured or threatened to act the way they did they could have disclosed what was happening to the authorities because as couriers they played a vital role in the illicit activity. The court added that it needed to take into consideration the quantity and purity of the drug imported. The court also considered the havoc that importation and distribution of illicit drugs caused on the local market, with the accused who had abused of the hospitality extended to them as visitors to the island by using such visit to further their criminal ends. Apart from the prison term and fine, the court even issued a Removal Order against the defendants, ordering their removal once they had served their sentence. The defendants appealed the decision claiming that in light of the various provisions of the law regarding punishment, they were deserving of a decreased imprisonment sentence. In addition, they argued the first court had failed to justify how it arrived to such a figure and failed to consider that without their admissions they would have suffered charges of a lesser nature. That is, the sentence they argued was disproportionate when compared to that passed on other persons found guilty of similar offences. The Court of Appeal started by saying that the court was not obliged to provide their mathematical calculations unless expressly required by law. In the case in question, the court had a wide margin of discretion with various degrees and latitudes of punishment and the appellants risked a maximum of life imprisonment. The lower court had provided a comprehensive account of all mitigating and aggravating circumstances and, while excluding life imprisonment, had taken into consideration their guilty plea and reduced the sentence by one degree. This meant that instead of a minimum of four years and maximum of thirty years, the punishment applicable was of a minimum of three years and maximum of twenty years. The Court of Appeal said it should not interfere with the punishment meted out except of grave reasons and in the present case the appellants had benefited extensively from reduction in the punishment. The court therefore dismissed the appeal and ordered the appellants to bear the expenses of both instances.",English,

The plaintiff, a Bulgarian national, had moved to Malta to live with her parents while studying at University. She started dating the defendant and fell pregnant after two months. The news shocked her because she barely knew the defendant and was not ready for parenthood. The news also negatively affected her parents who were strict Orthodox and refused to accept that their daughter give birth out of marriage. They pressured their daughter to get married and she eventually gave in and the couple married in secret without any celebration. After celebrating nuptials, the couple went to live in the defendant’s parents’ house and their girl was born about six months later. The plaintiff had reluctantly accepted the defendant’s pleads to go live with his parents but she soon started insisting with him for them to find a place of their own, as she found herself restricted in his parent’s household. Matrimonial life proved difficult for the plaintiff because she still had to get to know the defendant well and at the same time needed to get accustomed to a totally new culture. The couple’s relationship in this period was characterized by a lot of arguing because the defendant used to work night shifts and she felt that he was not contributing to help raise their daughter. Matrimonial life lasted nine months because following another argument, the plaintiff left the defendant’s household and went to live with her parents, taking their daughter with her. The plaintiff said that the defendant had since showed little interest in them and did not see his daughter even in the Christmas period. The court said that it was the plaintiff’s parents who had decided that the marriage should occur. Moreover, the court said the plaintiff went out of her way to please both her parents and the defendant, while the defendant was not prepared for married life and had acted egoistically towards his wife showing that he was incapable of carrying out his duties as a married man.

The plaintiff had underwent gender reassignment surgery transitioning from male to female, but this occurred at a time when legislation on the matter was still at an early stage. She therefore requested the court to order the defendant Director of Public Registry to correct her gender in her birth certificate while declaring that the deficiencies in Maltese law on the subject infringed on her rights as dictated by Articles 8 and 12 of the European Convention on Human Rights. In addition, the plaintiff requested the court to grant her recognition as female in regards to the Marriage Act opening the doors for her to marry in the future. The defendant rebutted that the plaintiff must first undergo a medical and scientific examination to convince the court that the change had indeed occurred and was irreversible, while stressing that the European Court gave leeway to the individual countries to legislate as they wished on the subject of marriage and therefore this was not a judicial matter. The first court commenced its considerations by saying that Maltese and European courts were in agreement that for the claim to be considered the court needed to be convinced of the plaintiff’s genuineness and the irreversibility of the transition. The court felt that both prerequisites had been met after an expert gynecologist had certified that the transitioning had indeed occurred. At this point, the court delved into a detailed historical, philosophical and juridical academic study on gender, marriage and fundamental rights. The court considered how marriage has existed since the beginning of time and according to Jewish and Christian beliefs only existed between man and women. It quoted the Genesis and the Gospels on the subject and considered the role that canon law had in Europe until the French Revolution started reducing the control Church had on marriage. In Malta changes occurred more slowly and moved away from canonical law only in 1974 but marriage, both in Malta and Europe, remained understood as the union between a man and a woman, protected as such because of its importance in the conception and nurture of children. Article 12 of the European Convention on Human Rights declares that every person has the right of a family but, said the court, it was written with the bond between a man and woman in mind and later judgements by the European Court had found that a State did not impinge on those rights if it did not allow for marriage between persons of the same sex. The court continued that while a State might introduce new rights, fundamental rights are unalienable rights and no new fundamental rights could be introduced. The court emphasized that this is more so when there does not exist widespread acceptance of the topic at a European level. Human rights have emerged from ideas of natural rights originating from Ancient Greece, said the court quoting roman jurist Ulpian and numerous philosophers including Plato. The court continued by saying that fundamental rights with basis in natural law can never guarantee that which is not natural, noting how a person who transitions to another sex retains the genetic makeup with which they were born. Marriage is an issue of public order and something of such importance should not be changed to cater for the needs of the few. If the few become majority, then the legislator might decide to introduce such rights but these rights would never be fundamental as understood in international and natural law. The court concluded that the plaintiff’s right for respect of private life had been impinged upon by the deficiencies in local legislation which did not account for transgender individuals who wished to change their gender on their birth certificate and ordered the defendant to carry out the necessary changes in the plaintiff’s birth certificate. The court however rejected the plaintiff’s second request, saying that the court could not adjudicate hypothetical scenarios as it seemed that she did not have any concrete ideas to get married, and in addition to that, marriage between gays and transgender was not a fundamental right but is a right which the legislature decides on whether to introduce. On appeal, the plaintiff asked the court to reconsider the second part of the sentence and declare that her fundamental right of marriage had been impinged, while stressing the law courts were not ecclesiastical tribunals founded to uphold religious principles as the lower court seemed to have done. The constitutional court found that there was nothing incongruent, strange or unacceptable with the court’s quoting of philosophical and religious texts and invited the appellant to remember that the Catholic Church, albeit not always faithfully, was among the first to promote the idea of fundamental rights. More importantly, the court had made a purely academic exercise but the premise remained in that the courts could not adjudicate on a hypothetical scenario in which the appellant might someday decide to get married. In addition, it was not the court’s duty to introduce new legislation. The constitutional court therefore rejected the appeal and ordered the plaintiff to bear court expenses.",Maltese,

The defendant, a Somalian national, admitted to the charges but the court started by saying that this could not be considered as an early admission of guilt - therefore not eligible for a reduction in sentence - because the accused had only done so after the prosecution had brought most of the witness to testify and it could not be said that he had cooperated with the police. An expert had examined the illicit substance and confirmed that it was indeed 5.3 grams cannabis of 6% purity. The court did not accept the defendant’s claim that he had handed the drugs to the police after being caught red-handed, should in any way represent a mitigating factor. Neither did the court feel that the defendant’s differing culture, poverty and difficult situation back home should serve as mitigation factor, especially because he admitted to being employed albeit not in a regularised fashion. The court however did take into consideration his clean criminal conduct and ordered the return of the mobile phone and money found in his possession because the plaintiff had failed to prove that they were in any way related to the illegal activity, while no expert had been chosen to examine the phone.

The plaintiff, a Syrian national, explained that he had lived in Malta for the past twenty years and had successfully obtained Maltese citizenship. His Syrian wife had remained in her home country but the couple had then married by means of a power of attorney, with the marriage being registered in the Middle Eastern country. However, when the same marriage was registered in Malta, the plaintiff’s wife’s name was listed differently instead of what was indeed written on her Syrian passport. This meant that due to this error, his wife who by that time fled Syria and was stranded in Turkey, could not be reunited with her husband as she was finding difficulty in obtaining a visa. The plaintiff requested the court to deal with the issue with the utmost urgency in order to allow for family reunification. Apart from her passport, the plaintiff presented the affidavits of two persons who knew his wife and both confirmed that she had always been known by the name the plaintiff states and that the other name, had both a different meaning and pronunciation. The defendant refuted the claim that there had been any error on his end and said that the documents had been registered ad verbatim according to the official translation. The translator of the original document made an appearance in court and said that he had redone the translation and the correct translation of the plaintiff’s wife’s name was indeed as stated by plaintiff. The court did not find the translator’s testimony reliable as he had failed to explain why he had written a different name in the first certified translation but correct name in the second. The court noted how even though these were official translations, certified by the State of Syria, they might not always be correct. The court however took into consideration her passport and the witness accounts, all of which confirmed her correct identity.

The plaintiff, which was the Director of the Department for Social Welfare Standards had been entrusted by the American authorities with the duty to commence legal proceedings against the defendant and aid in the return of the child on the basis that the defendant had retained the child in contravention of the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction and Chapter 410 of the Laws of Malta. The minor was born in Pullman, Washington and removed from his habitual residence of Florida and taken together with his older brother who being of sixteen years of age, meant that he not legally considered a minor in America. Although the couple was de facto separated they were still legally married meaning that a change in the child’s habitual residence, without prior approval from the mother, was in contravention of the statute of the State of Florida which stipulated that in absence of a ‘Custody Order’ both parents had equal rights on the minor children. Shared parental authority meant that both parents should exercise their responsibilities without breaching the other parent’s rights, explained the plaintiff. The defendant acted without the consent of the mother who had been exercising her parental rights as granted by the civil law of Florida. The plaintiff therefore requested the court to order the child back to the United States while making the necessary arrangement to ensure that the defendant did not take the opportunity to enter another country as that would make the minor’s return much more difficult. The defendant rejected the claims saying that the mother had known and acquiesced to the child’s transfer so much so that she had even travelled to Malta to see the children and initially did nothing to request their return. In addition, it would be in the child’s best educational and psychological interests for him to remain in Malta, said the father. The lower court found that without doubt this was a case of illicit retention. The court noted how the father had said that in the future he planned on taking the children to the Dominican Republic because he wished to live in the Caribbean, thus further confirming that the defendant sought to do whatever he wished without ever feeling obliged to obtain consent from the mother. Although the child stated that he was happy in Malta and doing well at school, the court must act in the best interests of the children which might not necessarily be that of granting what the child wants. The first court argued that if it were based solely on the child’s wishes than the courts would not exist since to determine what was to be done one would simply ask the child. The court acceded to the plaintiff’s request. The defendant appealed the sentence saying that the lower court had made an improper evaluation of the evidence and reiterated the same points made in the first instance. The Court of Appeal noted that even though the mother had not initiated proceedings immediately, the situation changed when the appellant obstructed and hindered the contact between the mother and the children, even telling the court that he planned to change the children’s country of residence again without considering the mother. His animosity and hostility in her regard led him to do everything to remove the children from her life in breach of her custody rights. Even if it might be the case that the mother had acquiesced, her change of heart was enough to merit the children’s return, particularly in light of the fact that the couple would soon undergo divorce proceedings and the children’s custody would mostly certainly be a bone of contention concluded the court.

The plaintiffs were the owners, either through acquisition or inheritance, of a building in the main street of the capital city of Valletta. A building which in the 1940s had been leased to the Kings Own Band Club, allowing them the use of the facilities for an annual sum of £500. When Malta changed to Maltese currency the sum became 500 Maltese Lira and subsequently €1164.69 upon entry into the Eurozone. Since then, amendments had been made to legislation regulating lease which allowed owners to reevaluate the lease sums or terminate the contracts, but Article 1531J of the Laws of Malta had excluded properties used by band clubs, due to their perceived important socio-cultural role. The plaintiffs argued that the rent being paid did not reflect the architectural, cultural, historical, commercial and strategic value of the property or the revenue generated therein. The plaintiffs added that while Article 1531J intended to offer protection to tenants who use properties as band clubs, in order to reinforce the culture of Maltese band clubs which have an important historical role and are considered national heritage, if the civil authorities felt that the band clubs needed protection and subsidization, this protection should have been guaranteed by the State and not by the landlords. With the present law, the plaintiffs claimed that they were being discriminated against as it did not allow them to renegotiate or terminate leasing contracts, as was permissible to other landlords, and this went against Article 14 and Article 1 of Protocol 12 of the European Convention on Human Rights, Chapter 319 of the Laws of Malta and Article 45 of the Constitution of Malta. In addition, they were being denied peaceful enjoyment of their property as stipulated by Article 1 of the First Protocol of the European Convention on Human Rights and Article 37 of the Constitution of Malta. The defendants rebutted the plaintiffs’ claims by saying that the State had the right to control the use of property if it is deemed in public interest to do so and it was in the public interest to protect institutions such as band clubs which served a public function. When something serves a public function the value of the rent cannot be calculated according to market prices as that would place an unbearable burden on band clubs to the detriment of Maltese culture. The defendants said that no discrimination occurred as the plaintiffs were not treated differently to other persons in similar situations. The court noted how past sentences had concluded that any interference with property must also satisfy the requirement of proportionality, while the European Court had ruled that a private entity should not carry the burden of measures taken in the name of public interest. The court said that both the plaintiffs’ estimate of fair value of an annual lease of the property in question (€269,100) and the conservative estimate presented by the defendants (€93,000) indicated that proportionality was missing as the plaintiffs were earning far less than reasonably expected. The court therefore concluded that the rent law impinged on the plaintiffs’ right to enjoyment of the property and ordered the defendants to pay them €300,000 in lost revenue taking into consideration the original rent fee, the defendants’ own estimate and the fact that the tenant’s generated €45,000 from the band club’s bar facilities. The court however rejected the plaintiff’s claim that they were discriminated against as they had failed to prove that they were being treated differently to persons in the similar situations. Both compensation and court expenses were to be borne in half by the Prime Minister and Attorney General and the other half by the band club tenants.",Maltese,

The couple had celebrated marriage some ten years prior and shared three children. This marriage had occurred after a courtship of thirty days, a decision which the plaintiff said was influenced by the defendant’s risk of deportation due an expired residence permit. According to the plaintiff, once her husband, a Tunisian national, obtained freedom of movement, he started mistreating her with beatings and by failing to provide financial support to her and the children so much so that she had to seek a job for herself. After the birth of their child, he convinced her to relocate to his home country where they lived with the defendant’s mother. Things did not improve however, and the plaintiff recounted how the defendant would beat her even in front of his own mother, one time even by means of a horse whip. Even during their stay in Tunisia, the defendant refused to work and the family had to live upon the charitable donations of his mother. On one occasion, argued the plaintiff, the defendant took the plaintiff to an apartment where he introduced her to another woman and when the plaintiff objected to the proposed love triangle, he resorted to threatening and beating her again. After a car accident, he sent the plaintiff back to Malta demanding that she find employ and send money back to him. The plaintiff however rebelled and not only did she not send him money but she cut off all contact from the defendant and initiated annulment proceedings. The court noted how it was abundantly clear that not only did the defendant not respect the plaintiff as a woman nor as a person. The court argued the defendant did not comprehend the concept of an equal relationship between a man and a woman in the context of marriage and only married for his own egoistic goals while subjecting the plaintiff to every form of humiliation imaginable and a life of servitude. The court called for the introduction of harsher legislation pertaining to domestic violence. In addition, the court concluded that the defendant lacked the discretion necessary to comprehend and adopt the concept of married life according to the laws and culture of Malta. He simulated consent because he never had the intention of acting as married man and used the institution of marriage for his own personal objectives. The court therefore acceded to the plaintiff’s request and declared the marriage null, with court expense to be borne by the defendant.",Maltese,

The couple had met in a discotheque and married three years later. The defendant was a South African national who worked in London and this meant that the pair maintained contact through letter correspondence with face-to-face meetings limited to a few week per year. The court agreed that due to this arrangement the parties barely knew each other when they entered the marriage contract and this made it difficult for them to effectively commit themselves to a communal life together or observe the rights and duty deriving from the permanent union of marriage. After reading the plaintiff’s account the court felt that although he was aware of his situation, he was so infatuated with the defendant that he decided to ignore these evident difficulties and went along with the marriage. It was this infatuation that inhibited him from fully comprehending the consequences of the lack of communication with the defendant and the situation was not aided by the fact the parties arrived from very different cultures. The court found it worrying that the plaintiff had been told by the defendant that in her culture marriage was not a permanent and indissoluble union and yet he still agreed to celebrate marriage. This understanding of marriage went at odds with the essential elements of a valid marriage in accordance to the Maltese law and culture. The court therefore agreed to the plaintiff’s request and declared the marriage null with court expenses divided between the parties. The defendant did not take part in proceedings.",Maltese,

The plaintiff recounts how the two English co-nationals had met a few times at the former’s apartment in London where, together with a group of other people, they had discussed political issues which affected their country. Both parties managed right-leaning political websites under pseudonyms, with the plaintiff describing the defendant’s website as one which encouraged extremist, racist, anti-Semitic and anti-Muslim political discourse and which promoted the idea of religious crusades. The plaintiff on the other hand described his own website as one on which you find comments and declarations against Islamic terrorism and on the issue of racism. The plaintiff described the defendant as a “mentally unstable” individual who, for no apparent reason, carried out personal attacks against him, attacks which were without basis and imbued with falsehoods. The plaintiff presented three articles penned by the defendant which alleged that the plaintiff was the mentor of Andres Breivik, the convicted mass murderer responsible for the death of 77 persons in Norway in 2011. In addition, the defendant had alleged that the plaintiff was working against him to stop him from rising to the head of the English Defence League, a right-wing organization aimed at stopping the spread of Islam, Sharia Law and extremist Islam in England. These allegations, which persisted while court proceedings were underway, led the plaintiff to lose his job as Database manager within the European Bank for Resources and Development, causing him to postpone his marriage plans. The court expressed its regret that the defendant had refused to take part in proceedings, even though documents showed that he resided on the island. The court therefore had to base its judgement solely on the plaintiff’s claims but found them to be consistent with other findings and found no reason to discard them. It said that the articles indicated by the plaintiff were certainly libelous and defamatory and the allegation made in them certainly caused the plaintiff reputational damage. The court therefore accepted the plaintiff’s request, finding the defendant guilty and ordered him to pay €5,000 in damages, while also bearing all court expenses.",Maltese,

The plaintiffs were a couple, a Maltese wife and a Syrian husband who had married in Syria a year after the birth of their daughter but the defendant had refused to include the marriage in the local registry. The defendant explained that the marriage certificate, presented by the defendants and registered in Syria, showed the couple’s signatures but documentation indicated that they were in Malta on the day. This put serious doubt on the authenticity of the documents. In addition, marriage by power of attorney required prior authorization by the Marriage Registrar and was only permissible in exceptional cases. The defendant claimed that the plaintiff acted as they did in order to circumvent Maltese law, even because the husband’s visa had expired and his residency rights on the Island were at risk. The court noted how the couple had married by power of attorney in Syria with the husband represented by his mother and the wife by a lawyer. It noted how even though marriage by power of attorney was contemplated by Maltese law, this was only possible if one person resided in Malta and the other abroad, and the power of attorney required sanction by an authorized person. This meant that a marriage power of attorney necessitated greater formalities than a normal power of attorney and this indicated that the legislator was not willing to accept marriages by power of attorney except in particular circumstances. The court argued that marriage is an institution of public order and the language used in the legislation clearly shows that marriage needs to occur between two people present and only in special situations may a power of attorney be used. The court stressed that marriage was a serious institution and the defendant had every right to refuse the method of marriage which clearly hid ulterior motives which the plaintiffs had not originally divulged to the court.

The plaintiff explained how the government of the State of Libya had endeavoured to identify and recuperate funds and other financial assets illegally retained by members close to the fallen regime of Muammar Gaddafi. The Government of the State of Libya had given instruction to the Head of the Department of Litigation, which felt under the remit of the General Attorney, to cooperate with foreign jurisdictions in order to recuperate such funds. The plaintiff showed how Mutassim Gaddafi was the fourth son of the fallen dictator and who occupied the role of Official of the Libyan Army and Consultant on National Security, roles for which he was official paid the annual sum of €37,500. Mutassim Gaddafi, who died during the 2011 Revolution, was the sole shareholder of a company based in Malta named Capital Resources Limited and possessed numerous accounts in his name with the Bank of Valletta, both of which contained funds which far surpassed the money he could have legitimately obtained from his State roles. In addition, all officials of the Libyan Army were bound by Libyan Law to declare all of their and their spouses’ assets and prohibited them from engaging in any business activities, with failure of adherence constituting serious offences. The plaintiff explained that the deceased Libyan official had died a bachelor and, in this case, according to Libyan Law his inheritance was to pass on to his mother and brothers. The individuals in questions were all wanted by Libyan Authorities and Interpol and their whereabouts, apart from a few imprisoned in Libya, could only be speculated upon. The plaintiff continued that the deceased, had failed to declare these illegally obtained assets and were to be duly returned to the State of Libya. The plaintiff told the court that similar proceedings were taking place in other jurisdictions through the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties on Criminal Matters (MLAT). A lawyer was nominated to represent the interests of the defendants; namely the mother and supposed heir of Mutassim Gaddafi, and the company Capital Resources Limited which retained Mutassim Gaddafi’s funds in Malta. The defendant contradicted the plaintiff who said that Mutassim Gaddafi had died a bachelor and presented a letter from the Imam of the Malta branch of the Islamic Centre which said that he had left behind a wife and a son and, according to Libyan inheritance law which was based on Sharia Law, his mother was to inherit 1/6, his wife 1/8 and the son the rest, whilst his brothers were to inherit nothing. The defendant presented numerous objections against the plaintiff’s request, primarily that the court did not have jurisdiction to hear and decide on the case, that the plaintiff needed to satisfactorily prove both that he indeed had a mandate by the State of Libya to represent its interests on the case and that the claimant enjoyed the status of a State at international level. The defendant asked the court to consider these first three objections before delving into the merits of the case. The plaintiff presented a copy of the power of attorney granted to him by the Department of Litigations in the State of Libya, a department which dealt with civil cases which might involve foreign jurisdictions. He explained that while Libya at that moment in time had two entities, one in Tripoli and the other in Tobruk, both of which claimed to be the legitimate Libyan government, both entities recognized only one Attorney General and one Department of Litigations and that the plaintiff represented both the government recognized by Malta and the United Nations. A representative of the Bank of Valletta gave witness in court and said that there were five active bank accounts attributed to Mutassim Gaddafi which totalled a sum close to 100 million euros. A representative of The Ministry for Foreign Affairs confirmed that they had received a notification from the Libyan government authorizing the plaintiff to act in the interest of the Libyan State. This note verbale was received via the Libyan Permanent Representative to the United Nations in New York; an unorthodox method but which was accepted due to the unstable situation in the North African country. He explained that the Libyan Permanent Representative to the United Nations had plenipotentiary powers, strong enough to bind the Government of Libya. In addition to this note verbale, the court was presented with a Letter of Authorisation from the Chairman of the Department of Litigation in Libya that confirmed the investiture of the plaintiff as special procurator of the State of Libya. The court found that the plaintiff had succeeded in providing unconfutable proof regarding his legitimate role in the matter, in that he was indeed representing the State of Libya and, had it not been so, he never would have received the approval of the United Nations representative. In addition, the funds present in the company Capital Resources Limited were located on the Island and therefore Malta had jurisdiction to hear and adjudicate on the matter. The court therefore rejected the defendant’s objections and gave the go-ahead for the hearings on the case to proceed.",Maltese,

The couple had undergone a personal separation which stipulated that care and custody of their child was to remain shared between them. The child resided with the defendant with the father making use of his access rights four to five times a week. The defendant had travelled to Malta with the child upon written permission of the father but failed to return. After the agreed-upon seventy-five-day period had elapsed the mother told the child’s father that they could not fly back because the child was suffering from a depressive episode but then cut off all contact from the father. The plaintiff was entrusted by Canadian authorities to commence legal proceedings against the defendant and aid in the return of the child, on the basis that the defendant had retained the child in contravention of the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction and Chapter 410 of the Laws of Malta. The change in the child’s habitual residence without prior approval from the father impeded him from exercising his parental rights according to Canada’s civil code. The defendant rejected the claims, saying that she had exclusive care and custody of the child and that she had left for Malta with approval from the father. Her decision not to return was motivated by the fact that life in Malta was better for the child, because it was far away from the father’s bad influence of cannabis and alcohol addiction. She complained that the father failed to retain regular employment and was known to steal from his parents while failing to provide the maintenance stipulated by their personal separation. If the child were to be forced to return to Canada, she argued, she would end up living with paternal grandparents and this was not in the best interest of the child who within four years had adjusted to life in Malta. The child’s school officials took the stand and said that to their knowledge the minor had never mentioned Canada or her father and she adapted well and made numerous friendships. The court started off by saying that it had to decide if the child was to be returned to Canada and not delve deeply into custody and maintenance rights. The proceedings needed to determine whether the father had exercised his access rights prior to their departure for Malta and whether he had in actual fact shared care and custody. The court concluded that there was no doubt that these two criteria had been sufficiently proven by the plaintiff and that the mother’s actions had constituted wrongful retainment as defined by the Convention. Nonetheless, the court noted that the Convention allowed for children to be returned when proceedings are initiated more than a year after retained by one parent if it was proven that the minor had not yet adapted to the new environment. The court noted that the father had instituted proceedings with the Maltese authorities only years after the mother’s arrival in Malta and in the meantime – as confirmed by the school administration – the child had successfully adapted to life in Malta. The concluded that the child was content, had settled, lived a content life and considered Malta as her home country or at least country of residence. She had many friendships, adapted to Maltese traditions and customs and the Maltese daily routine. All this was in conformity to the definition of “settled” as stipulated by the Convention and ordering the child’s return would mean uprooting her once again from an environment she had adapted to leading to further trauma. Enough time elapsed for all her friends and family to be in Malta, while in Canada she would only have her father. The child had established herself on the island and ordering her back to Canada would not be in her best interests. The court therefore rejected the plaintiff’s request and ordered that the minor should remain in Malta with her mother.",Maltese,

The defendant and the victim were both English language students living in the same apartment and while there was no particular animosity between the pair, the defendant was not glad that the victim had been placed with him because he had a reputation of being an alcoholic and a truant. One night, the victim was found lying on the floor and taken to hospital. The police were called on site and determined that the injuries sustained were not consistent with what was described on site and ordered a medical exam to be carried out. The victim was found to be in the Glasgow Coma Scale 11/15 and in danger of dying. He had two black eyes with swelling, brain hemorrhage and contusions, a nasal bone fracture and numerous abrasions and bruises strewn across his body. According to the medical practitioners who attended to the victim in hospital, the injuries were consistent with a beating rather than a fall. Numerous eyewitness accounts from the opposite side of the road were heard in court and all said to have seen the victim very inebriated and pulled to the ground by the defendant, who then resorted to kicking him while he laid on the ground. The defendant argued that the victim was very drunk and told him that he was going to jump from the balcony. The defendant explained that at that moment he hit the victim on the face to make him realize what he was saying, causing the victim to fall on the ground. Once on the ground the victim started hitting his head against the floor at which point the defendant started kicking him to make him stop. The defendant and other Korean friends present in the aftermath claimed to have cleaned the floor from the blood because it was in Korean culture to keep the place clean and in order. They said that nobody called an ambulance because they did not realize it was serious and they thought he had lost consciousness due to his drunken state. The court noted how the defendant did not deny hitting the victim which resulted in both grievous and minor injuries. The court rejected the idea that the defendant hit the victim to stop him from jumping as the latter was in a helpless drunken state and there would have been no need to hit him both before and after landing on the ground. The court also refused to delve into Korean cleaning tradition and said that everything indicated that the blood had been cleaned from the scene in order to cover their tracks and mislead the investigation. The court found the defendant guilty of the charges brought against him and, after taking in consideration his clean criminal record, sentenced him to eight months imprisonment suspended as long as he did not commit another crime in the following eighteen months.

The plaintiff met the defendant, a Mexican national, while she was studying English in Malta and after dating for three months, she had returned to her home country because her visa had expired. The plaintiff followed her because he wished to see where she came from and looked forward for the opportunity to meet her family. Upon arriving the plaintiff says that he was hit with a culture shock due to the great poverty he witnessed. After two months in Mexico the couple returned to Malta where they spent a further two months together at which point, she told the plaintiff that it was inconvenient for her to travel between Malta and Mexico every few months and, even though the plaintiff paid all the expenses, the defendant told him that she was not willing to return unless they got married. The plaintiff was surprised at the request and, after confiding with a few friends, he informed her that he had no intention of marrying yet. The defendant was very disappointed by the answer, so much so that she packed everything and left for Mexico. Once in her home-country, the plaintiff received a telephone call from her mother who told him that her daughter would only return to Malta if they got married. The defendant cut off all contact with the plaintiff and the latter was left with no other option but to buy a plane ticket and go find her at her home. When she opened the door, he told her that he wanted them to be back together but she insisted that they could only continue if they celebrated nuptials. The plaintiff recounted how he ended up accepting this albeit he was still against the idea of marriage. Three weeks later the parties had celebrated nuptials and returned to Malta. The defendant’s mother made daily to phone calls in order to receive updates on her daughter’s documentation, a process which ended up taking five months because the necessary papers needed to arrive from Mexico. After five months their marriage was registered in Malta, at which point the newly-wed wife told her husband that she felt caged on the Island and wished to return to Central America, in order to study. The defendant’s mother intervened on this issue and told him that if he really loved her daughter he would accept her wish to study in her country for three years. The defendant acted homesick and the plaintiff decided to buy her a plane ticket for Mexico, with the agreement that she would return after a month when she felt better. However, after three weeks in her native country, his wife called him saying that she had no intention of returning. At the time of court proceedings, the plaintiff had not seen or heard from the defendant for two and a half years and their marriage had lasted some six months. The plaintiff’s mother testified and said she had always considered the defendant as very opportunistic; one who would start kissing and telling the plaintiff that she loved him every time she wanted something. She felt that her son was willing to do everything, including incur all expenses, for the defendant. She says that she found it strange that marriage was first discussed while the two parties were living in different countries and realised what was happening when her son told her that he was marrying the defendant but that she had requested for the plaintiff’s mother not to be present. The court said that in view of the circumstances that led to the marriage, particularly the defendant’s wish to obtain a visa and the plaintiff’s willingness not to keep paying for the defendant’s travels to and from Mexico, it was clear that the parties married only for a matter of convenience. The convenience of having the defendant living in Malta without the need to travel every few months, and only this explained the hurried nuptials without giving the least consideration or preparation for a married life.

The couple had been introduced to the defendant, a Russian national living in her native country, by a mutual friend who was himself married to a Russian woman. They started sending letters to each other, and after three correspondence letters she travelled to Malta to meet the plaintiff. The plaintiff says that when they first met, he was surprised by her lack of knowledge of the English language and suspected that the letters she sent him had been written by somebody else. When they went out she would carry a dictionary with her and the plaintiff described her as being very cold, something he attributed to a perceived character trait typical of all Russian women. The plaintiff claimed that during the defendant’s second’s visit she suggested for them to get married and he immediately took up her idea and agreed to buy an apartment out of his own funds. On the third visit they chose their marriage date and celebrated nuptials some ten months after first getting to know each other. Very few family members were present for the occasion and no one from the defendant’s side so much so that right until the marriage ended the plaintiff had never had the opportunity to meet his wife’s parents. The plaintiff admitted that he even though he was Catholic, he preferred not to celebrate the marriage in Church as he was not entirely sure about the marriage. The plaintiff says that the defendant’s cold attitude persisted after marriage and they only had very few sexual relations. She was indifferent to the plaintiff and never discussed her ideas or future plans. He says that his wife was only interested in progressing her career and making money and there was never a strong bond between them, in fact they rarely talked and when they did, they could not communicate effectively due to evident language barrier. He claims that they never discussed sentimental or personal issues and while he never weighed the consequences of married life, she remained cold with him throughout the year-long marriage and never sought his company. The defendant remained unwilling to have sexual relations even after marriage and after six months she went to sleep in a totally different bed and brought up work excuses in order to avoid spending time with the plaintiff. Both parties agreed not to have children. The plaintiff said that he agreed to it because he was doubtful whether he was making the right decision in marrying, but still wanted to go ahead with it because he was totally infatuated by the defendant. The plaintiff said he suspected that the defendant only married him in order to be able to reside and work on the island. He said that the defendant later told him that she had never loved him but respected him as a person. The defendant rejected the claims that the marriage was eligible for annulment, saying that it had been contracted validly and regularly. She said that it was the defendant who proposed to get married and that she was hesitant at first and doubtful if she wanted to leave her life, family and job in Volgograd to reside in Malta. After thinking about it however, she had an honest intention of getting married in order to set up a family with the defendant and have children. Contrary to her husband’s claims, the defendant says that they had agreed not to celebrate a religious marriage because he was Catholic while she was Orthodox. Money was the relationship’s greatest problem and she claims that she only sought employment because the plaintiff wanted her to be a housewife without providing her with financial support. The defendant says that she went into marriage with the firm desire of having it succeeded and indeed she formed a strong bond with the plaintiff’s parents and sister, while her husband on the other hand never even got to meet her own parents and did not show any intention of travelling to Russia in order to do so. The court said that judging from the evidence produced the parties barely knew each other before contracting marriage and while the plaintiff did so due to pure infatuation, the defendant had the clear wish of residing in Malta. The necessary discretion for matrimonial life was missing because they barely knew each other, in part because of the consistent language barrier that existed and in part due to brief and hurried nature of their courtship. Both had their egoistical reasons for getting married but none of parties had reflected on the implications and duties of conjugal life. The court said that the plaintiff himself admitted to excluding children from the marriage and avoided celebrating nuptials in Church because he was unsure about the marriage, meaning that he did not believe in the permanence and indissolubility of marriage. Similarly, the defendant simulated consent as she excluded having children from the onset by avoiding intimate relations with the plaintiff.

In the meantime, the plaintiff had remarried a German national residing in his home country and wished to join him there while offering to provide the defendant access rights during the scholastic holidays and regular video calls. The plaintiff added that should her request be refused, at no point would she consider giving up custody of the child. The plaintiff’s husband took part in proceedings and said that he loved the minor and would care of him as though he were his own. He said that he would have no problem providing the child’s father with ample access as he shared custody to a child of his own and knew very well of the importance of a fatherly figure in a child’s life. The defendant, a German national himself but a long-time resident in Malta, objected to the changes saying that it was not in the minor’s best interest to reside in a foreign country, with no friends or grasp of the language and far from the influence of his father. He said that the plaintiff wished to unilaterally change the terms of the separation contract which had stipulated that the defendant had twice-weekly access rights and that the child could travel from the island but only for short holidays not longer than twenty-one days. The defendant said that he was barely given the opportunity to communicate with his son when he was in Malta and feared that he would lose all contact if they had to relocate to Germany. In addition, if the child lived in a foreign jurisdiction access would not be enforceable by the Maltese Courts. According to the defendant, the court should ensure that the plaintiff’s request was in the minor’s best interests and that such a change was preferential to the status quo. The defendant was also dismayed that Germany was being described as the land of opportunity while Malta as a backwater, underdeveloped country. The minor had dual Maltese-German citizenship and no matter the outcome he should be proud of his origins and culture and should be taught to stand tall before anyone who speaks negatively of his home-country, argued the defendant. The minor’s father further stressed his concern about moving to a foreign country, highlighting the fact that the child’s lack of knowledge of the German language and the fact that immigrant children were not easily accepted in German society, would make integration hard in a country where racist attacks against foreigners were a common occurrence. The defendant also had concerns regarding the plaintiff’s religious beliefs, saying that she had joined a sect and risked alienating the minor from the Roman Catholic faith in which he was raised. A court-appointed expert interviewed the child who reported that the child said he wished to relocate to Germany, although further investigation made it clear that he would have gone anywhere as long as he remained with his mother. He confirmed that he wished to retain contact and a good relationship with his father in a way which was convenient for both parents. During proceedings it came to the attention of the court that the plaintiff had allegedly abducted the minor and taken him to Germany. A German court found her actions to be unlawful and ordered them back to Malta. The court noted how this case revolved around two main issues: the child’s supreme interests and contractual obligations entered into by both parties during separation proceedings. While the latter terms were clear, the court wished to put aside the contractual point of view and analyse the requests related to the child’s life which had serious implications on the minor’s life, education, lifestyle and formation. The child had always lived with his mother and therefore having to choose he would always prefer to please his mother than his father. However, his father was very present in the child’s life and it would be the minor’s best interest for it to remain so, just as the plaintiff’s husband had not wished to relocate from Germany while sharing custody of his own child. Even though it was unfortunate that a married couple was not given the opportunity to live under the same roof, it was the court’s duty to put the child’s best interests in the forefront. In addition, the court was not convinced that the defendant would have effective access to the child, just as contact had indeed deteriorated between them when the child had been unlawfully removed from Malta and such contact was only re-established once they returned to the island. On an educational level, the child by the time of sentencing had reached the age of fourteen and within two years would have had to undergo major examinations, a process which would prove much more complicated were he to transfer to a different country, with a different curriculum and inevitable language barriers. The court therefore rejected the plaintiff’s requests and ordered her to bear court expenses.",English,

The couple had met online some six months before marrying and a short while later the defendant agreed to travel to Syria to personally meet the plaintiff. After two weeks in each other’s company, they decided to marry because the plaintiff’s culture did not allow him to have intimate relationships before nuptials. The marriage celebrations took place in Syria and after, the couple relocated to Malta. However, after a short period of cohabitation arguments soon ensued and they realised that they had made a mistake. The plaintiff in particular complained that the defendant would wear immodest clothing while living a life of no restraint. He said that the defendant was not the woman he had really married. A few days later the plaintiff left the conjugal home and thus, the couple were already de facto separated after only a few days so much so that the police authorities discovered that he was living separated to his wife and deported him back to his home country. The court said that it was evident that the parties did not understand or realise the meaning of a conjugal life, in particular that of domestic partnership aimed at the reciprocal well-being and the procreation of children.

The couple had married eleven years prior but after five years they were already de facto separated. The plaintiff said that the defendant, a Tunisian national, was very egoistic and did not have the least consideration for anyone or anything else that involved the family. She accused him of only thinking about going out with friends, drinking and watching football while practically living the life of a bachelor. She argued that he never helped out at home, often saying that in his culture women were considered inferior. The defendant agreed with the plaintiff’s request for annulment but placed the blame entirely on her shoulders. He claimed that she was a very jealous person and that the marriage had been a hurried affair so much so that on the day of the marriage they did not even have a place of their own and ended up renting a place. After the birth of their daughter, the mother would spend most of the day at her mother’s house said the defendant and eventually started going out on her own at times returning home in the early hours of the morning. The court started off by saying that judging from the evidence produced the parties did not show the least commitment towards a conjugal life together. At no moment of their relationship argued the court, did they have the discretion necessary to conceive and understand the essential elements of marriage. The court said that it was not at all clear why they had decided to get married in the first place, since their relationship was solely one of incompatibility and continuous conflict. Neither was there any respect shown towards each other and this continued until the parties separated. The court concluded by saying that disharmony was of the few constants which the parties contributed towards each other.

A representative of the translation company took the stand and admitted that a genuine error had occurred on their part and that the plaintiff had been presented with another translation of her original birth certificate and which now bore the correct details. The defendant said that he registered ad verbatim the details founded on the translated documents presented by the plaintiff and as admitted by the plaintiff herself, no error was attributable to the defendant. The court noted how the defendant was duty-bound to input the details as received and although the translation had been an official one approved by the Saudi state, it did not mean that it was necessarily free from errors. The court therefore appointed various experts to assist in the case. These included a translator fluent in Arabic and English, an associate professor of Oriental Studies at the University of Malta and a Moroccan national, active in numerous organizations namely the Moroccan Community in Malta and the Migrant Women Association Malta.

The plaintiff had presented the defendant with their Libyan marriage certificate and its translation into the English language which translation was carried out by a Libyan company.

The husband’s name was written as “Mahammed” instead of “Mahamed” and many mistakes in his parent’s full names. On the other end, the wife’s full name was written differently among many other mistakes in her parent’s names.

In the written report sworn upon and submitted by the court expert, she compares the Latin transcription of the Libyan names to the transcription provided by a translator company that was hired by the plaintiffs. She discusses the difference between adding the article “al-” to a surname by using a hyphen (common in Maltese) and without the hyphen (such as in English or French). The court expert also discusses the use of vowels in Arabic, explaining that whilst in classical Arabic there is use of only three vowels, in other Arabic dialects there is use of five vowels. The expert reports that the difference in English/Latin transcription of the names depends on various uncontrolled factors: 1. the level of education of the person transcribing, 2. the country of the transcription and whether it was an English or French colony 3. the type of dialect of the country, because it makes a difference in the vowels used 4. the fact that there is no official guide on how translation or transcription of Arabic names to European languages should be made and to which European language ex. English, French, Spanish…so on. The expert adds an example of the name Mohamed to explain this. Whilst the Arabic version is always the same, Mohamed, Muhamed, Muhammad, Mohammed, Muhammed, are all different acceptable versions of the same name popular among the Muslim community. She adds the example of the name Rashid or Rachid to explain that which country makes the transcription also impacts the name; the sound ‘x’ in Maltese, is ‘sh’ in English, and ‘ch’ in French. Therefor there is a high probability that in French colonies such as Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco or Syria the name would be written as Rachid but in English colonies like Egypt, Sudan, Saudi Arabia and Gulf countries the name would be written as Rashid, and in Maltese, the transcription would be Raxid.

In order to back his claim, the plaintiff presented numerous documents including his Libyan passport and marriage certificate, together with the birth certificates of his two minor children. He also presented academic certificates, a document issued by the transitional Libyan government and a copy of his Family Book, all of which confirmed that his name was as he claimed. In addition, the plaintiff introduced the affidavits of two family friends who backed his claims and that in Libya they had a habit of using these nicknames instead of the official surname. The plaintiff pleaded to the court to grant the changes, saying that the discrepancies were causing him great inconvenience. The defendant represented by the Director of Public Registry said that it was the plaintiff’s father who had signed his birth certificate which listed him by the name on the documents and that at no moment did he object to how his name was written, so much so that he had signed. In addition, the defendant said that the same documents presented by the plaintiff were not consistent. The court enlisted the help of an expert in the Arabic language who translated the voluminous documentation and concluded that the plaintiff’s claims were well-founded.

The plaintiff was born in a period when the Registry did not formally ask for the new-born’s surname, as it was taken for granted that it would automatically take the father’s surname. The error therefore stemmed from the plaintiff’s father’s name as written on the former’s birth certificate. The plaintiff explained that in Arabic tradition a child was given three names; his personal name, his father’s and thirdly his paternal grandfather’s, together with the family surname. He explained that his family’s name had always been --.He admitted that his mother might have committed an error while registering his birth as at that time she did not know English or Maltese. In addition, the plaintiff also lamented the fact that on the same birth certificate his mother’s name was written incorrectly and requested the court to change it. In order to prove his case, the plaintiff presented numerous documentations, including his and his parent’s Libyan birth certificates and passports. The defendant objected, saying that before signing the birth registration the plaintiff’s mother had been given ample opportunity to ensure that the details were correct, meaning that the defendant should not be liable for any court expenses incurred. In addition, the defendant noted how it was strange that the Libyan birth certificate differed from the Maltese documents, since the plaintiff was born in Malta, and his details should be transcribed word for word according to the documentation provided by his country of birth. In addition, the defendant said that it was peculiar that the plaintiff only wished to carry out these changes at the age of twenty-eight. The court sought the help of an expert in the translation from Arabic to English who, after reviewing all documentation, made a number of conclusions which confirmed the plaintiff’s claims.

The expert explained that the Arabic articles which are often included in surnames could be translated with or without the article as the article does not change the surname. The expert also explained that it is customary that Libyan passports include two pages with personal details of the passport holders; one in Arabic and another page at the end with the English version.

The plaintiff, native of Libya, explained that in Arabic tradition a person was given three names; his personal name, his father’s name and his paternal grandfather’s name, together with the family surname. The name was in actual fact his grandfather’s name and he presented numerous documents to back up his claim, including his Libyan birth certificate. The plaintiff had obtained Maltese citizenship through marriage and his Maltese passport and Identity Card all bore the correct surname. The error, however, persisted in his birth certificate and this had repercussions on his minor children because when he tried to register them with the correct surname, the defendant had told him that by law they were obliged to use the surname found on the plaintiff’s passport. The defendant Director of Public Registry rebutted claiming that the details on the children’s birth certificate had been written by the plaintiff himself. It was common practice for the details to be read out aloud before allowing the applicant to check the details himself before signing. The plaintiff therefore had at no moment indicated his surname to be another. In order to register his and his children’s birth, the plaintiff had presented his Libyan passport. The defendant lamented about the numerous errors that are committed by the registration systems of foreign jurisdictions, especially those of Arabic countries, whose nationals are allowed to reside in Malta for a number of years with an incorrect identity. In this case, the defendant noted how the plaintiff had been perfectly content to live for a number of years with an incorrect surname and was only spurned into carrying out the necessary changes when he was forced to present his Libyan birth certificate in order to obtain citizenship. The situation had been further complicated by the Libyan Consulate in Malta which had issued a letter in the plaintiff’s name and in which they referred to him by his incorrect surname. The court appointed an expert in the translation from Arabic to English, who confirmed that the plaintiff’s surname has claimed by the plaintiff.

He said that his whole family was known by that name and that this discrepancy between official documentation was causing him great difficulties. The defendant said that the plaintiff’s birth had been registered ad verbatim based on an authentic translation approved by the Syrian authorities and provided by the plaintiff himself. The defendant also noted how on the application form submitted, the plaintiff had indicated a different spelling while further on it was written another. The court noted how it was encountering many cases of errors in authentic translation relating to birth certificates issued by North African authorities. The court pondered whether it would be better for Maltese authorities to employ translators of its own to ensure that the work carried out by other jurisdictions was correct. This would be done to avoid scenarios in which persons live many years in Malta, during which period they work, marry and have children, and do so under a wrong name and surname.

The couple had met when the defendant, a Syrian national, was experiencing difficulties to reside in Malta, with the authorities having arrested him and subsequently deported. In fact, during the couple’s five-month courtship, the plaintiff had often visited the defendant, during which time he promised to her that if she agreed to marry him, he would gladly spend their conjugal life in Malta. So even though they had initially wished to wait two years before marrying, the defendant’s difficulties in obtaining a visa led the couple to marry after a much shorter courtship and they did so in Egypt which is to where the Maltese authorities had deported him. The plaintiff said that the couple was happy together until a year and a half into the marriage when she fell pregnant. The defendant started travelling to his home country more often, and on one occasion he stayed away for two and a half months. He started pressuring the plaintiff for them to visit Syria but she refused fearing that he would try to retain their daughter. The relationship worsened considerably and the plaintiff ended up giving in to the pressure and agreed for the family to go to Syria with the daughter who by the time was three years old. There, the plaintiff said that her husband started being physically abusive and told her that while she was in his country she had to abide by his rules. Due to this violent behaviour the plaintiff wished to return to Malta with her daughter after more than three months away but the defendant refused saying that their daughter would not get to leave Syria before the age of eighteen. He also told her that her visa was close to expiry and it would not be possible for him to extend it since their marriage was not registered in Syria. This led the plaintiff to leave on her own, only to return to Syria, unbeknown to her husband and with the help of a third party, managed to locate her daughter and take her back to Malta. After a turbulent marriage of seven years the couple split and by the time of proceedings had been de facto separated for a number of years. The defendant rejected the plaintiff’s claims and rebutted that the marriage was indeed null but due to reasons attributable entirely to the defendant. In particular, he said that it was the plaintiff’s consent which was vitiated and he denied her claims that he had married a second wife while in Syria. He did however confirm that he wished his daughter to be raised in Syria in order for her to learn reading and writing in Arabic. The court argued that the plaintiff’s version of events was much more credible. During marriage, the defendant had shown emotional immaturity in respect to his wife and great insensitivity towards her needs and rights. He had deceived her when prior to marriage he had promised he would live with her in Malta but instead, upon birth of their daughter, he sought to take their child to his native country without the least consideration for the plaintiff’s objections. In order to accomplish his goal, he was even prepared to separate the daughter from her mother. He cheated his wife when he gave his consent to marriage because he hid from her his really intentions. The court noted that the defendant was incapable of accepting the matrimonial obligations based on a union of reciprocal well-being necessary for establishing a communion of life and love between the parties. The court therefore acceded to the plaintiff’s request and declared the marriage null, with court expenses borne by the defendant.",Maltese,

The defendant, an Algerian national, had entered the country irregularly by boat and upon arrival had applied for refugee status. He was sent to a Detention Centre, where the defendant said that he lived in very poor conditions. A few months after arriving, a group of persons, one of whom the appellant, were accused of carrying out a protest that turned violent. Twenty-two individuals were subsequently found guilty, among other things of reviling, threatening, or causing bodily harm to any person lawfully charged with a public duty, of partaking in an unlawful assembly, voluntarily damaging property, not obeying lawful orders, or breaking the public peace and of throwing rocks and other hard objects. All the accused had pleaded guilty to the charges brought against them, but the defendant appealed, claiming that he had not understood the accusations brought against him and that it had not been his intention to plead guilty. He claimed that all of the twenty-two accused had been represented by the same lawyer and that he was never given the opportunity to understand the charges brought against. He said that he was never explained the implications of admitting to the charges and that he did not understand what was happening during proceedings. The appellant said that he had been pressured into admitting his guilt, that he was ignored by the translator and that he had not been given an adequate representation. He also claimed that the case should be dropped because his name was misspelled in the charge sheet. The lawyer who represented all the accused including the appellant, said that she was the first person to voice her concern about the fact that she was handed a group of twenty-two persons to represent. She had asked the court of first instance to hand her a smaller number of clients or provide her help from other legal aids, but her request had been denied. She therefore set about dividing the persons in smaller groups based on their native language, with each group having an interpreter knowledgeable in that particular language. The lawyer said that she had been given amble time by the court and she had made herself available for any questions that the accused might have had. The groups were divided in Arabic, French, Tigrinya, Oromo and Maltese speaking, with the Algerian appellant having a working knowledge of both French and Arabic. The Arabic translator denied the claims that he had pressured or ignored the appellant and said that the latter, being Algerian, was knowledgeable in both French and Arabic and in one instance sought the French translator in order to confirm something he had not fully understood. This, the translator continued, meant that the defendant had access not only to him but to at least one other person from whom he could have sought assistance. According to the translator, at no point did the defendant tell him that he was not understanding or that he wished to retract his guilty plea. The Court of Appeal also examined the court minutes and it noted how in the first sitting the accused had all pleaded not guilty, only to change their plea in the second sitting. The court added that the minutes of the sitting clearly indicated that the court had granted a long break in order to allow the accused to discuss their plea change with their lawyer and once proceedings recommenced, the sitting judge asked the defendants if they had had enough time to consult with their lawyer, and after receiving no objection, went on to explain to them, with the aid of the interpreters, what the implications for a guilty plea were. In all these instances, the Court of Appeal noted how the appellant had not voiced his concern. The court immediately threw out the defendant’s claim that charges should be dropped due to a misspelling in his name, saying that the police worked with the name the appellant had given them upon arrival by boat, and therefore the defendant’s name should be considered as the one registered with the Maltese authorities. The court admitted that the quality of legal assistance could have been better and, as noted by both him and the legal aid who represented him at the time, similar scenarios in which one lawyer is handed a crowd of twenty-two individuals should be avoided in the future. However, the court continued, this did not mean that appellant had not been in a position to understand the nature of the charges or that it was not his intention to admit it to them. The defendant had been given ample time by both his lawyer and the court to voice any concern he had, and at no point did he do so. In addition, the appellant had the availability of not one interpreter, but two, and had he been ignored by one as claimed, he could have consulted with the other. And he did consult with both of them, but not for the issues that he raised in the appeal. The court concluded that it was not convinced that there had been objective or subjective reasons for the appellant to not understand what was going on and to what he was admitting. The court therefore rejected the appeal and confirmed the sentence.",Maltese,

The issue had stemmed from a rivalry that existed in Victoria, the capital city of Gozo, which celebrated two feasts: one dedicated to St. George at the Parish Basilica dedicated to the same saint, and another one dedicated to the Assumption of Mary at the city’s Cathedral. The plaintiff, the archpriest of the Cathedral, managed a radio station and during one airing he invited a local lawyer who served as the President of the Leone Philharmonic Society which was the band club affiliated to the feast of the Assumption of Mary. During his intervention, the lawyer had said some things which the defendant parish archpriest found to be insulting, both towards him personally as well as his role as a priest, and also towards the Parish of St. George. The defendant had written letters complaining both to the Archbishop of Gozo and the Public Broadcasting Authority, with the latter finding the lawyer’s intervention on Radju Katidral, which described the defendant as being amongst other things dishonest and a liar, as not aiding the building of comradeship between members of the same community. It found the statements pronounced in the radio programme supervised by the plaintiff as being inappropriate, and which went against the license agreement which forbade the spread of sectarian hate among the community. It said that the band club president should have been stopped, corrected or a delay mechanism should have been utilized in order to avoid the transmission of the incriminated phrases. The Authority ordered the plaintiff priest to issue an apology on the radio station, and even handed him a paragraph he needed to read word for word, after the plaintiff had issued an apology which the Authority had not found satisfactory. The defendant stated his pleasure in the periodical “Il-Belt Victoria” published by the Parish of St. George and in which he proclaimed to have accepted the apology and considered the issue settled. However, a few months later, the same periodical published an article titled ‘The Truth about the Public Broadcasting Authority’s Condemnation of Radju Katidral’ in which it was said that the Authority had found the Cathedral’s archpriest guilty of disseminating hate by allowing his guest to say those words on air and failing to stop or correct him. The plaintiff asked the court to find the defendant guilty of defamation for mentioning the plaintiff by name and attributing to him the words uttered by somebody else, in addition to accusing him of spreading hate. The defendant objected to the claims saying that he was not the editor of the publication and that the article in question was not defamatory. The lower court started by saying that it found the issue wholly unnecessary because although the defendant had said that he accepted the apology, he then went on to fan the flames by publishing the incriminated article in the parish’s periodical. The court lamented that issues like these served to further damage the Church as a religious institution, in a historical period of difficulties that were far more important than parish feasts celebrated once a year. The clergy had the duty to reduce and not increase the rivalries and division which were brought about by some village feasts. The feast tradition, the court continued, is an integral part of Maltese culture and are celebrations meant to bring about cohesion and happiness, while putting aside fanaticism, which only leads to damage and further division. In addition, members of the clergy should not tolerate or express compassion to whomever creates hostility and tension with the excuse of defending the parish’s honour. The court rejected the defendant’s notion that he was not the publication’s editor because by his own admission the publication fell under his authority. The court however focused on the Public Broadcasting Authority’s letter which had found the radio programme to have breached its licensing condition which prohibited the dissemination of sectorial hate and had found that the defendant had not been treated fairly. The court found that nothing wrong had been committed when the plaintiff was named in the article because after all it was him who was presenting the radio programme when the incident occurred. In addition, the court did not find the periodical guilty of publishing falsehoods and found the reported facts to be essentially correct. The Authority’s letter had been published supplementary to the article, allowing the readers to make their own conclusions and no evidence of an attempt at misleading the reader had been found. The plaintiff appealed the sentence claiming that the lower court had made an incorrect interpretation of the law. The Court of Appeal said that there could be no doubt that the Public Broadcasting Authority had every right to intervene when it deemed broadcasters to be in breach of their terms of license, in the best interest of the community or society as a whole. It was also within their remit to order persons in breach of the license agreement to issue ratifications or apologies. The article did not frame the plaintiff as guilty of any crime but limited itself to publishing the Authority’s letter and preproduced it in an objective and impersonal manner. It limited itself to reporting the case, without breaking any laws relating to media. The court therefore rejected the plaintiff’s appeal and ordered him to bear all expenses.",Maltese,

She had care and custody and wanted to pursue her doctorate in the UK. The plaintiff had told the Family Court that as a requirement to her post as full-time Assistant Lecturer at the University of Malta, she was contractually bound to obtain a PhD in her field. She said that she had been accepted and awarded a scholarship for a full-time PhD in London. She therefore needed to take up residence in the UK at the end of the school term, or else risk having her scholarship terminated with serious implications to her career. The defendant father of the child said he did not receive confirmation from either University about the plaintiff’s scholarship and he suspected that the plaintiff was using it as an excuse in order to further thwart the father’s attempts to have access to his son. The plaintiff brought to witness stand her superior, the Dean of her Faculty, who confirmed the plaintiff’s claims. The plaintiff argued all study-related financial assistance was going to be provided and successful completion of her PhD studies was particular importance for the development of academic programmes offered by the institution. The plaintiff claimed that her residency in the UK would only be temporary, as she had every intention of returning to her full-time position at the University and reassured the court that she would be returning to her home-country during summer and Christmas recess in order for the child to remain in contact with his Maltese family and Maltese culture. After completing her studies, she would benefit from salary increases and better work opportunities, which in turn would be of benefit to the child. The defendant, a German national residing in his home country, objected to allowing his child’s mother to take up residence abroad, saying that the plaintiff already made it difficult for him to see his minor child in Malta and allowing her take up residence in a foreign jurisdiction would render his access practically impossible. He detailed how the plaintiff had ignored court orders, police and court marshals in regards to his access. She would often disappear with the child when he visited the Island, causing him great stress and anxiety. The defendant worried that the plaintiff would end up overextending her stay in the UK in order to keep the child away from him. The Family court judged the plaintiff’s request to be justified and quoted European case law in which it was said that the primary carer of a minor had the right to determine the residence of the child, while bearing in mind the best interests of the latter. The court noted that the relocation was temporary and that nothing impeded the father from travelling to the UK instead of Malta to gain access to the child. It rejected the notion that the experience would be traumatic to the child, considering that he presumably spoke the language fluently and that there was no radical cultural difference between the two countries. The court felt that, on the contrary, the experience would prove beneficial to the child. It therefore acceded to the plaintiff’s request but placed a number of conditions; such as, it ordered the plaintiff to present a sworn note with all contact details in the UK while binding her to notify immediately of any changes that might occur. The minor’s passport had to be restricted to Malta-UK only and order the plaintiff to return the child to Malta within the following year. She was also bound to make all the arrangements necessary for the access currently granted to the father to be retained. In addition, it also ordered that the child spends seven days with the father during both the summer and Christmas recess. The court took note of the plaintiff’s lack of cooperation with the previous court orders and therefore bound her to enter into a bond of €7,000, which she would forego in favour of the defendant if she did not strictly adhere to all of the above conditions. It also stipulated that the plaintiff pay the defendant €5,400 in order to cover the expenses that he needlessly incurred in order to obtain access in Malta. The court reprimanded the plaintiff for past behaviour including going in hiding until the father’s days of access had passed. Both parties appealed the sentence, the defendant asking the court to reconsider its decision or at least impose more stringent guarantees, while the plaintiff contended that the existing conditions were too burdensome. The Court of Appeal found that the court of first instance had successfully struck a balance between the interests of the parties, as well as the interest of the child. The Court of Appeal however partially accepted the defendant’s request to place even stricter conditions on the mother, taking into consideration the numerous instances in which she had disobeyed court orders on the matter. It thus increased the bond in security for compliance to €10,000, while ordering each party to bear its own costs relative to the appeal.",English,

The couple were residing in France when the defendant had left for Malta, taking the children with her. The father, a French national, had sought recourse with the French courts which had decided that while it was in the children’s best interests to continue residing in Malta, the children should not be denied access to their father. It had found that the children had been uprooted from their French origins at a very young age and did not know their father’s family. It stressed that the children should be exposed to another culture whilst maintaining strong bonds with their French relations. Court appointed psychologists found that the son had slight to moderate autism which does not impede him from travelling, especially with other members of his family. The Maltese courts had to stipulate the exact method by which access would occur. The court allowed the father to exercise his access in Malta or France for half of the summer and Christmas holidays; for the first half of the said holidays in even years and for the second half of the holidays in odd years. The father was wholly responsible for collecting the children and making the necessary arrangements should he wish to take them to France, binding him to notify the defendant of the exact dates at least two months prior. The court had ordered a copy of the sentence to be sent to the French central authorities and warned the defendant that failure to cooperate would result in action taken against her. The defendant appealed the sentence saying that the minor’s father should be obliged to exercise his access rights in Malta because she feared that if they were allowed to travel to France their father would not allow them to return. On the other hand, the father refused to travel to Malta because he feared that criminal actions would be taken against him due to pending maintenance obligations he had with the defendant. The defendant based her appeal on four main points; that the lower court did not have the discretion to decide which country access had to be carried out, that the court had not consider the irreparable damage that would occur if the children were allowed to travel abroad, that the location of access should not be left to the discretion of the father and that the court expenses should not be borne entirely by the defendant. The defendant said that she had never objected to the father seeing the children in their country of residence. In addition, she argued the father had failed to provide details on how and with whom the children would be spending their time while in France and said that autism would cause one of the children great difficulty adapting to life in a foreign country where he did not speak the language and surrounded by people he did not know. The defendant continued that the father was an unreliable person, while adding that she was preoccupied that while in France the father would attempt to alter the autistic child’s longstanding treatment plan. The director of the Department for Social Welfare Standards had been entrusted in overseeing that the decision handed down by the French courts was enforced and appeared as plaintiff in the case. He said that it was not correct to say that the Maltese court had overstepped its authority and that the appellant’s recriminations revolved around the merits of the case and not its execution. The court acted in accordance to the judgement handed down by the French courts, and in its role as enforcer. The Maltese court could not delve into the merits of a case which were already dealt with by a foreign jurisdiction. The plaintiff continued that the expenses were to be borne by the defendant as she had obstinately refused to follow legitimate orders handed down by the French authorities. The Court of Appeal agreed with the plaintiff’s claims and said that the issue of access had already been dealt with by the French courts and that the Maltese counterparts were solely responsible for stipulating how the arrangements would occur. If the defendant felt aggrieved by a judgment handed down by the French courts, she should take recourse directly with them. The Court of Appeal said that the French court had taken into consideration the best interests of the minors, believing that it would be beneficial for them to have their father in their lives, while being exposed to the culture of his side of the family and their native country. The French court had given the father the opportunity to decide if to exercise his access rights in Malta or France, and the Maltese courts had no option but to fully accept the judgement. The Court of Appeal said that it was legally unacceptable for the defendant to accept the part of the sentence that decided that the children should continue residing in Malta, but then refuse to cooperate when it came to the father’s visitation rights. As regards the court expenses, the court found that they were to be attributed to the mother because her claims were weak and baseless and, right up till the day of sentencing, she had continued to deny the children access to their father and his family. All attempts by the father, authorities and French Consulate proved futile as the appellant had remained unyielding in her position. The Court of Appeal therefore confirmed the lower court’s judgement but stipulated the times of the day at which the children should be collected and returned to their mother.

The Chinese plaintiff and Ukrainian defendant had married in Beijing, China, eleven years prior with their elder daughter being born in Washington, America, while the younger sibling was born on the Chinese mainland. A few months before proceedings were underway, the parties had agreed for the defendant to take their first new-born with him to reside briefly in Malta to allow him to apply and obtain a long-term visa for the child from the Chinese Embassy as this would allow her to attend an international school in Beijing. The defendant however had not followed the agreement and refused to return to China, forcing the plaintiff to travel to Malta in order to be with her daughter. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant’s actions were in contravention of the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction because he had changed the child’s habitual residence without prior consent from the mother, while undermining her parental rights. The plaintiff also requested the court to provide her with the authority to obtain all the travel documentation necessary for the minor without the need for prior consent from the defendant. The defendant responded that the court did not have the jurisdiction to hand the care and custody to a parent whose ordinary residence will be abroad and neither did it have jurisdiction as regards the issuance of visas by other countries. In addition, the defendant claimed that the minor’s principal residence was Malta with there being no reason for this to change. He argued it would not be in the best interests of the minor to be taken to a completely different environment as she would receive a better education in a European country while in China she would be kept away from her father. The latter also alleged that the plaintiff was mentally unstable, violent and neglectful. The lower court immediately brushed away the defendant’s claims that the court lacked jurisdiction and said there could be no doubt the defendant had wrongfully retained the minor in Malta with her habitual residence being China. The child at the time had never left the country prior to the defendant’s actions. She had absolutely no links in Malta except for the defendant, while in China she had her mother, younger sister and grandparents. She spoke Chinese and attended a Chinese school. The court felt that the defendant had not acted in the best interests of the child when separating her from her sister and uprooted her from the country where she was being brought up and schooled. No credible evidence had been brought to sustain his claims that the plaintiff was not an adequate carer and custodian. The lower court therefore acceded to all of the plaintiff’s requests and decided that she should be vested with exclusive care and custody of the child, whose residence should be in China. The defendant appealed the sentence reiterating the previous claims that the court did not have jurisdiction to decide upon the merits of the case, that the plaintiff was an inadequate carer of the child and that it was in the child’s best interests to continue residing in Malta. The Court of Appeal started by saying that irrespective of where the defendant chose to live, the court had jurisdiction to decide on the care and custody of the child. The plaintiff had come to Malta in order to be with her daughter and needed the court’s permission to take her back to China. Both parties and the child were presently in Malta and therefore the Maltese courts had jurisdiction to decide on the matter. The Court of Appeal confirmed the lower court’s impression that the defendant had failed to substantiate his claims regarding the mother’s inadequacy in raising the child and questioned, if that were the case, why had he contacted the plaintiff asking her to relocate in Malta for them to be reunited. The Court of Appeal said that there was no evidence that the child was in any danger while she was habitually residing in China and the fact that the couple owned a house in Malta had no relevance in proceedings. Neither was there any evidence that the minor would have an improved quality of life in Malta or a better education in the EU as opposed to her native country. The plaintiff on the other hand had confirmed her attachment for her daughter by travelling to Malta to be with her and by the time of the appeal more than two years had passed since her forced relocation. In order to do so however, she had left her younger daughter in China and this was due to the appellant’s unlawful actions which had caused great pain to both the plaintiff and their two young daughters. The court therefore confirmed the lower court’s sentence except for the part in which it refused to grant the appellant visitation rights, ordering remote one-hour access twice a week.

The plaintiffs owned a prominent house overlooking the Maltese town square of Paola, which thirty-four years prior they had been leased to the defendant, the Philharmonic Society. They had since used the premises against an annual payment of 450 Maltese lira (€1048.22). Before the turn of the millennium, the Rent Regulation Board had authorized the plaintiffs to retake control of their property after the defendant band club had carried out structural alterations to the property without prior authorisation from the owners and in breach of the terms of lease. This decision had been confirmed some ten years later by the Court of Appeal, which gave the defendants five months to vacate the premises. However, before the end of this deadline, Act No. XXVII of 2018 was entrenched into law emending Article 1531J of the Civil Code which had been created to exempt band club from the previous lease reform. This amendment stipulated that band clubs older than thirty years and which leased a property for use as their principle headquarters could not be evicted by the Rent Regulation Board if they had carried out structural alterations which consisted in works related to their philharmonic or social activities granted that these works were ameliorations to the premises and the band club provided financial guarantees which according to the Board sufficed in allowing the owners to restore or make the required changes once the lease period ended. The plaintiffs claimed that this amendment constituted breaches in their fundamental rights as protected by the European Convention on Human Rights and requested the court to declare that the defendant could not make use of said amendment and requested that court order the vacation of the property. The plaintiffs also requested monetary compensation for the damages sustained. The defendants, represented by the aforementioned band club and State Advocate, argued that the First Article of the First Protocol of the European Convention protected the State’s right to pass the necessary legislation to control the use of property according to general interest. The amendment had been intended to protect band clubs because these helped the social, cultural and folkloristic identity to flourish, while working relentlessly in the development of musical talent among the numerous youths that attended the many band clubs spread across the country by providing teachings and instruments without any payment. They argued that this amendment could therefore not be classified as not being in the general interest and the legislator had toiled to create a balance between the interests of the owners and tenants. Additionally, the plaintiffs had entered into the lease agreement freely meaning that there was no illicit confiscation involved, while Article 14 of the Convention did not apply because no discrimination had occurred in that the plaintiffs had not been treated differently to other persons in a similar situation. The defendant society in particular noted that the amendment had increased the lease value by tenfold meaning that it there was a party who had been damaged by the amendment it had been them. The Court of Appeal started by saying that Articles 13 and 14 of the Convention were not applicable because, the plaintiffs did have adequate legal recourse for their grievances and they had failed to prove that they had suffered discrimination. The court then turned to Article 6 which protects a person’s right for a fair hearing. It explained that the court gave this Article extensive interpretation in order to avoid the erosion of legal guarantees; meaning that it was valid not only for what occurred before and during proceedings, but even after by ensuring that judgements are successfully executed. The interference or lack of cooperation in the execution of a delivered judgement need not only occur by the Executive branch, but also by the Legislative branch which would render judgements ineffectual by the introduction of new laws. The court noted that the defendants had claimed that the amendment had been predictable because throughout the years the State had done its utmost to protect band clubs in light of the cultural benefits they inferred, meaning that it was in the society’s general interests for their activities to continue uninterrupted. The court felt that these reasons did not justify legislative interference because there were no compelling reasons considering that this particular case involved protection of tenants who broke their contractual obligations and this was certainly not in public interest. The court concluded that the legislative intervention had nullified a legitimate court judgement in breach of Article 6 which protected legal certainty and the finality of court judgements as essential requirement of a democratic society based on rule of law and separation of powers. The court then turned its attention to Article 1 of the First Protocol and said that there could be no doubt that the amendment constituted undue interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of the property. It had failed to protect the principal of proportionality because it had been created ad hoc after the appealed court judgement and intended to solely affect the plaintiffs. In fact, five days after the judgement, the Minister for Justice, Culture and Local Government had intervened in the media confirming that the government would intervene to ensure that the band club would not lose it premises. The amendment protected a contract which was indefinite thus limiting the landlord’s right to regain control of the property. In addition, the compensation granted by the amendment did not reflect the value of the property which was calculated at 1.8M Euro, with a yearly lease value of 66,000 Euro (3,66% of the market value). The amendment instead had capped the lease to 1% of the property’s value and for an indefinite period of time. The court therefore acceded to the plaintiff’s request, declaring that the amendment to Article 1531J of the Civil Code breached the plaintiff’s fundamental rights and that the defendant society could not make use of said law to remain on the premises. The court ordered that the plaintiffs receive 165,000 Euro in way of lost revenue and liquidated the damages to 70,000 Euro, which were not meant to represent the market value but a balance between the interests of both parties. The court also added a 4000 Euro in non-pecuniary fee in favour of the plaintiffs, with both the monetary damages and the court expenses to be borne by the State Advocate.",Maltese,

The defendant agreed to the request of annulment, however claiming deception on the part of the plaintiff. The couple’s version of events differed on when the parties had first met and decided to marry. The plaintiff claimed that the parties had known each other for two years, with the defendant who had fallen out with her father especially because of her relationship with the plaintiff. She had therefore left her family’s home and went to live with the plaintiff who however insisted on getting married because his Muslim religion did not permit him to live with an unmarried woman. The plaintiff claimed that she immediately agreed to it but abandoned him when she discovered he was impotent. On the other hand, the defendant claimed that she married the plaintiff four weeks after first meeting him. She said that it was the plaintiff who abandoned her after five weeks of marriage and when she contacted him, he told her that the marriage had ended and advised her not to talk to him again. This version of events was confirmed by the defendant’s mother who told the court that she had only found out about the marriage when it had already occurred since her daughter had left their home and only returned one year later. The court said that it was immediately evident that both parties had a serious defect of discretion about matrimonial life because their thoughts were never directed towards family life but instead both had their selfish goals. The defendant needed a place to stay after leaving her parents’ house and the plaintiff wanted to be able to live with her and not go against his religion. The court noted that curiously enough the parties had not married by Muslim rites as a reason to doubt the plaintiff’s claims. Moreover, he followed his religious obligations of informing his future wife about his impotency, something he admitted to have been well aware of. The court concluded the plaintiff’s consent was vitiated because he knowingly withheld this fact from the defendant without the least consideration of what her feelings were in this regard. The defendant had every right to know about this because child procreation was one of the essential elements of marriage, both catholic and civil. With the religious excuse debunked, the defendant’s version resulted more realistic in that the plaintiff had not proposed to marry after two years but after little more than a month. The court further argued that on the other hand, the defendant never had the intention of seriously living with the plaintiff and only took the opportunity to escape her problems at home, thus entering marriage with little or no thought about the future, thinking that she was going to solve her problems by marrying a person she barely knew. Court said that the defendant was clearly immature, particularly due to her very young age, and at the time she was incapable of forming or giving the consent necessary for marriage because it was impossible for her to understand the significance of marriage and the rights and obligations derived from it. The court therefore acceded to the plaintiff’s request and granted the annulment of the marriage, with court expenses to be divided between the parties as both of them had been responsible for its failure.",Maltese,

The police said that in the early hours of the morning they had been called to Paceville, a nightlife hub, because a fight had broken out and a person had been injured. They found a man of Libyan origin being medicated by a passerby who happened to be a qualified nurse. The victim was taken to hospital and subsequently interviewed by the police who told them that there had been an argument between two groups of Arabs. He recounted that he had tried to calm down a man wearing a red cap who was particularly agitated and who at one moment threw a beer bottle in the direction of his adversaries. The victim told the police that he had intervened because he did not like the fact that Arab men had the reputation of being violent and argumentative, and when he did not succeed in calming the beer-bottle throwing man, he called on the accused to restrain his friend. The victim said that there was a little scuffle, at which point the defendant put his hand across the victim’s neck. The victim claimed he did not see any weapon in the accused’s hands but said that he was the only one who had touched him, and a short while later he found himself stumbling and falling to the floor with blood pouring out of his neck. The victim indicated his attacker as being the boyfriend of the woman who had seen to his injuries, leading the police to the accused. Numerous people took the witness stand, including the accused’s girlfriend. The woman in particular said that she did not know why the fight broke out between her boyfriend’s group of friends who were from Tripoli and the other group who were from Benghazi, but she said that she had heard personal insults being thrown around, something she had been able to understand because she had been married for ten years to an Arab man. She said she saw a man wearing a white cap turning his head around which, from what she knew about Arabic culture, meant that he wished the argument to continue. Nobody claimed to have seen the accused hitting or attacking the victim, nor did anyone claim to have seen him in possession of any weapon. The accused himself said that he did not carry any knives around and a search at his household and at the location of the fight did not produce the weapon used. The police argued that when interrogated, the accused suffered from “total amnesia”, as he could not recall any single detail. The accused rejected all accusations, saying that even though he did not remember anything he was certain that he had not caused any injuries to the victim because he was not a violent person and never carried any weapons. The defense told the court that the police should have investigated a man seen running away from the scene and which nobody had been able to identify with certainty. Had the accused grievously injured the victim he would have not remained at the location with his own nurse girlfriend attending to the injuries. The doctor who saw to the victim told the court that the victim had two lesions on either side of his neck and these were classifiable as incised wounds caused by a sharp object. The injuries had been wider than deep and it was this that saved his life, because had they been any deeper they would have punctured the artery, resulting fatal. The court said that the issue revolved around the credibility of the witnesses and it lamented that it had received the case when all parties had already given witness and therefore it had not been in a position to control and confirm the credibility and veracity of their claims. This created a scenario in which the court was not in a favorable position to examine all evidence produced. It continued that the prosecution had failed to determine exactly when and in which direction the beer bottle had been thrown as no one had seen the accused bearing a weapon of any sort. Even the same victim who indicated the defendant as being the perpetrator, admitted that he had not seen any weapon in his hands. The court concluded that it did not have the necessary certainty that the defendant had caused the victim’s injuries and therefore should not be held responsible for the incident. Consequently, the defendant was freed from all charges.",Maltese,

The court noted that unlike the procedure applicable to European Arrest Warrants in force within the European Union area, this extradition procedure was regulated by traditional extradition laws in which the powers of the courts were relatively limited and where the Minister for Justice retained wide powers and discretion. The court noted the complexity of the case in hand due to the different legal backgrounds and traditions in Malta and Chile. The two countries did not have an Extradition Treaty and therefore resorted to the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime of the 15th November 2000, which both countries were signatories. It was the court’s responsibility to determine to what extent this extradition request could be granted, based on this Convention in terms of Maltese Law. The Extradition Act of the Laws of Malta required the confirmation of the identity of the requested person and in this case the defendant had not contested this fact. Nor did the court find any issue with the Authority to Proceed issued by the Ministry. The court was also required to determine whether the offenses according to the Convention are punishable with a term of imprisonment of twelve months of greater and that the offenses also constitute an offense according to Maltese laws. The Convention also required both countries to be satisfied that the extradition procedures were carried out in accordance and in compliance with their respective laws and procedures, while the court also need to be satisfied that the offenses mentioned in the extradition request were crimes punishable under Chilean Law. In this regard, Chile was accusing the defendant of fraud and money laundering among other crimes. The court noted that the convention required that the crimes be of a serious nature, involving transnationality and organized criminal groups and that the dual criminality rule be satisfied. While the court accepted that the crimes the defendant was accused of were of a serious nature, the court added it must study whether it was an organized criminal activity. In this regard, the court needed to review the evidence produced by the plaintiff in order to determine whether the defendant had indeed committed the alleged crimes mentioned in the request for extradition, through a structured group of three or more persons. This needed to have existed for a period of time with the aim of committing one or more Convention crimes or other serious offences in order to obtain direct or indirect financial or other material benefit. For this to occur, any evidence submitted must be in line with the Maltese legal requirements governing admissibility of evidence. The court took issue with the plaintiff’s claim that all evidence produced should be accepted by the court because it was all in line with the Extradition Act which had been amended to lower the bar of what evidence was to be deemed admissible. If this were the case, the court continued, it would mean that the Maltese Courts would become a simple depository of foreign documents with very limited power of scrutiny and would be forced to take any document as evidence and proof of their contents simply because purported to be signed, certified or authenticated according to the Act. It was therefore the court’s duty to analyse to what extent a document could be deemed to be admissible or containing valid evidence in terms of Maltese Law. The court continued that according to Maltese law, this required statements to be confirmed on oath and contrary to the plaintiff’s stand, not all evidence produced could be considered a valid testimony since a testimony required a valid oath. A Maltese court could not accept as a valid testimony a declaration of a person that did not in essence satisfy the requirement of an oath in terms of Maltese Law. Even a document purporting to set out evidence on oath in Chile still needed to satisfy basic Maltese Law of evidence, meaning that the declarant must also make a declaration affirming that what was stated is the truth. The court said that Maltese law required a positive and explicit declaration that the declarant’s statement amounted to the truth and a court could not assume that a person was saying the truth. The fact that declarants stated that that they had read and understood their rights or that the declaration had been voluntarily made, or that the declarant read and ratified all the parts and voluntarily signed the declaration is not enough to satisfy this Maltese requirement. Moreover, confirming or approving what is stated did not necessarily mean that what was stated was being positively confirmed as corresponding to the truth. In this case the court noted that the witness statements provided by the Chilean prosecution were not made under oath and this was the exact opposite of what Maltese Law required from a witness in criminal proceedings. This meant that the court could not accept the statements provided by the plaintiff as valid testimony in terms of Maltese Law. Another problem which the court felt directly affected the admissibility of the testimonies provided was that most of them involved the statements of co-principals and accomplices intended to be used against the defendant. However Maltese law stipulates that when a person is accused of a crime with accomplices, the latter could not be produced to testify in favour or against that same accused unless and until the cases against the accomplices were res judicata. The court concluded that while there was prima facie proof that the defendant carried out various business ventures that raised suspicion, on the admissible evidence, the court, could not state that there was enough evidence to prove on a prima facie level that the defendant had carried out the acts the plaintiff was accusing him of. The court therefore dismissed the plaintiff’s request for extradition and ordered the defendant’s release from custody.",English,

The issue stemmed from Directive 2009/147/KE of the European Parliament and Council of Europe on the Conservation of Wild Birds, intended for the conservation of all species of naturally occurring wild birds in the European Member States and covered the protection, management and control of these species while laying down rules for their exploitation. The Directive allowed the countries to derogate from the prohibitions for a number of reasons such as public health and safety or for reasons linked to education and research. It also permitted the Members States to institute measures which were even more restrictive than the ones devised by the Directive. Malta had made use of this derogation in order to allow spring hunting following its 2004 membership in the European Union. The European Commission had opened proceedings against Malta because the derogation targeted the common quail (Coturnix coturnix) and European turtle dove (Streptopelia turtur) during their migration period, meaning that in doing so Malta went against its obligations as defined by the Directive which bound the States to ensure that migratory species were not subject to hunting during their return to breeding grounds. The European Court found that the conditions for derogation were not satisfied when the period of hunting permitted unnecessarily coincided with the period during which the Directive was intended to establish particular protections. It had rejected Malta’s protestations saying that a derogation could only be implemented if it guaranteed that the specie populations were going to be kept at a satisfactory level and, in absence of such guarantees, bird hunting could not be considered reasonable and this rendered the derogation inadmissible. Spring hunting differed from autumn hunting in that it resulted in three times more deaths in the common quail and eight-fold in turtle dove deaths. In response, the Maltese government had amended the derogation in order allow spring hunting while still adhering to the European Court judgement. This led the Coalition to Abolish Spring Hunting to carry out an exercise of signature collection in order to trigger Article 14(1) of Chapter 237 of the Laws of Malta which allowed for national referenda to be called out after the obtainment of a minimum number of endorsing signatures. A few months later the Electoral Commission had declared that there were enough signatories for the request to be accepted. This led the plaintiffs to resort to the constitutional court, listing a number of reasons why the referendum to ban spring hunting should not be allowed. The plaintiff put into doubt the verification process carried out by the Commission, in particular how they had validated the authenticity of the signatures. The court rebutted that the Commission had explained how it carried out its verification and listed which signatures were valid and which were not. The court said that in absence of clear evidence on why the court should not accept the Commission’s decision, the court must reject the plaintiffs’ claim and refuse its request for the data gathered to have the signatures examined by a calligraphy expert. The court noted that 33,418 signatures were needed for the referendum, meaning that even if 19% of the 41,494 collected were removed, there would still be sufficient for the referendum to occur. The court also brushed away the plaintiffs’ claim that the referendum would be delegitimising a derogation permitted by the Directive. It noted that adherence to the Directive was compulsory, but the derogation was not. A Member State could therefore decide to derogate to harshen further the prohibitions imposed. The Directive’s emphasis lay on the need for protective measures, more than on the recreational need, meaning that if these interests were in conflict a popular referendum with free choice as per law was a good method for solving the issue. The plaintiff also quoted the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, a treaty adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1966, and which recognized everyone’s right to, among other things, take part in cultural life whilst also binding States with working towards the conservation, development and diffusion of science and culture. The plaintiffs argued that a referendum which gave the possibility to ban spring hunting altogether violated this treaty, of which Malta was signatory, and put in danger a person’s right to hunt which in itself is an integral part of Maltese culture and tradition. The court noted that cultural life as understood by the Covenant included all human activity and therefore, if the law prohibited a particular activity this did not mean that it was prohibiting participation in cultural life. Finally, the court refuted the plaintiffs’ claim that the referendum risked prejudicing the will of the minority, saying that while it was true that the majority’s rights needed to be carried out with respect towards that of minorities, this respect was not obtained by not allowing citizens voicing their opinion through referendum. The law contemplated few scenarios in which a referendum was not to be permitted and, like every exception, they had a very limited interpretation. The court therefore rejected the plaintiff’s request and ordered them to bear all court expenses.",Maltese,

The couple, a Maltese woman and a Libyan man, had returned to Malta after spending twenty years in Libya where they had married through Muslim marriage rites. The woman had been previously married to a Maltese national, but after two years left Malta for Libya. Three months later the marriage had been declared null by Libyan authorities and the plaintiffs married. The plaintiffs claimed that the domicile of their marriage had been Libya and the defendant Director of Public Registry’s refusal to recognize their marriage forced the husband to periodically visit the Immigration Office in order to obtain temporary residence permits. The plaintiffs claimed that according to international law, the validity of a marriage depended on the relevant laws in the country where it was celebrated and the defendant’s refusal was in breach of the their fundamental rights. In particular of Article 8 and 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights which stipulated a person’s right for family life and free from religious-based discrimination. The defendant started off by saying that the plaintiffs had no right to undertake Constitutional Court proceedings when they had not yet exhausted all avenues at an ordinary level. He also rejected the plaintiff’s claims on the merit, saying that according to the Maltese law, the woman was still bound by her previous marriage as he had not been supplied with a judgement on the matter by a relevant court, nor did the plaintiff’s provide proof of their domicile in Libya. The defendant was bound to ensure that the previously contracted marriage had been annulled and that the second marriage was not polygamous in nature, as this would infringe Maltese public policy. The plaintiffs presented a translated certificate issued by which the Court of First Instance of South Tripoli had granted the plaintiff annulment of her previous marriage in accordance to Islamic Law because she had converted to Islam and married a Muslim man, thus rendering null her previous marriage to a Maltese man of Christian faith. The defendant noted how this certificate had been issued almost twenty years after marrying in Libya and that Maltese law did not recognize automatic marriage annulments based on a change in religion, with the plaintiff having failed to prove that her previous marriage had been legally annulled. In addition, the plaintiffs’ right to family life had not been impinged as they were free to exercise that right in another country as they had indeed done for the previous twenty years. The first Court accepted the defendant’s objection that the plaintiffs should have sought recourse in the ordinary courts before instituting constitutional proceedings. However, it also delved into the merits of the case and deemed the defendant’s actions not to be in breach of the plaintiffs’ Fundamental Rights. The plaintiffs appealed the judgement saying that the court had been incorrect when it said that other recourse was available, but after deciding so, it should have stopped short of entering into the merits of the case. The Court of Appeal said that a decision by a foreign court about the status of a married Maltese citizen must be recognized by Maltese law, however the plaintiffs failed to provide evidence in this regard. In addition, a person needed to be eligible to marry according to the laws in the country they are domiciled and, even in this instance, the plaintiffs had failed to prove that they domiciled in Libya. It agreed with the previous court that the plaintiffs needed to exhaust all recourse in the lower courts before filing a case with the Constitutional Court, thus rejecting the appellant’s request. However, it agreed with the plaintiffs that the first Court should not have proceeded to enter into the merits of the case. The Court of Appeal thus ordered that part of the sentence be erased with costs to be borne between the appellants and the defendant.",Maltese,

The application had been refused because the quarry was situated in the vicinity of a Class A World Heritage Archaeological site, namely the two megalithic temple complexes of Hagar Him and Mnajdra. The Tribunal had said that the development sat in An Area of Ecological Importance, Area of High Landscape Value, Site of Scientific Importance and Area of Archeological Importance. The proposal went against both Structure Plan Policies which did not allow for activity which would adversely affect scenic value by obstructing a particularly panoramic view and Local Plan Policies which forbade quarrying within one kilometer of a World Heritage site. In front of the Tribunal, the applicant appellant had claimed that he would have made use of modern equipment which cut stone without the emission of noise or dust, and which limestone could then be transported and processed in another site. The applicant had noted how in the past, when the same site was quarried using explosives, the vibrations produced where much lower than the maximum permissible. The appellant had reminded the Tribunal that the stone in the quarry site in question was arguably of the highest quality on the Island, making it indispensable at a moment when the concrete requirements were on the rise. He also said that he could not accept the Superintendence of Cultural Heritage’s argument that rock cutting was not permissible within one kilometer radius of the Temples, when some rock cutting was involved in the construction of a Visitor’s Site to the same Temples, and which was situated only 80 metres away. The appellant also argued that works would be carried out using a system of tunnels that would not disturb the external rock structure. The Superintendence of Cultural Heritage on the other hand said that work at the quarry had been stopped some fifteen years prior and that their opinion had not changed; in that no activity should occur at the sites and that the existing quarries should be refilled and rehabilitated in order to restore the cultural landscape of the valley. He said that they did not delve into the technicality of works carried out because they held firm in their belief that any quarrying activity, whatever the methods used, were incompatible with a world heritage site, and therefore unacceptable. He explained that it was not the first application they had rejected in the area and that, in accordance to UNESCO guidelines, they were bound to show opposition no matter the scale of the issue. The Superintendence explained that the temples were not the only archeological sites in the area, but there were also the Misqa Tanks and catacombs on the opposite side of the proposed quarry. He insisted that the site was an important part of the Maltese cultural heritage and that the Superintendence had been against any form of quarrying activity in the area since the 1960s, both due to the visual impact and the vibrations that might be produced by machinery. He explained that the Visitor’s Centre mentioned by the applicant and proposed by Heritage Malta, the country’s national agency for cultural heritage, had been amended due to the same reasons. They had used a system of trenching which was different to the activity carried out in quarries, and the machinery used was similarly incomparable to that utilized in industrial development. The tribunal had for these reasons rejected the plaintiff’s application, listing the numerous policies which forbade industrial activity in an area which deserved the highest environmental protection. In addition, the Tribunal had noted that the applicant’s application had been vague and he had not detailed the way in which modern machinery differed from the previous and how they intended to go about the quarrying activity. The Tribunal concluded by saying that if they did not intervene by rejecting the application, it would mean that some time or another the environment and cultural landscapes of world heritage sites like the one in question would all end up being destroyed. The plaintiff appealed the Tribunal’s decision in front of the courts, saying that it had not investigated the case attentively, that the adjacent Visitor Centre had involved similar works, that it had not analyzed all the documentation provided, including those which detailed the machinery that would be used, and that the Tribunal had not taken into consideration all the points raised by the applicant. The Court of Appeal said that the plaintiff’s appeal based itself considerably on interpretations, assessments and considerations which were not the court’s responsibility to decide upon. The court could only intervene if it found that the appellant’s rights had been breached. The courts had no authority to judge the credibility and competence of the Tribunal and the Superintendence of Cultural Heritage. Even if the tribunal had incorrectly interpreted some points raised, the court could only intervene if these facts were crucial in their decision making. The Tribunal, the appeal court continued, had not based its decision on the machinery or quarrying method used but primarily on the Structure and Local Plan Policies which forbade quarrying from occurring in the area of archeological heritage park in order to ensure protection to the World Heritage Prehistoric Temples. At no stage did the appellant claim that these policies were inapplicable or that other policies applied. In addition, the fact other works had occurred in the vicinity gave no right to the applicant, and the Superintendence had explained his role in limiting the development while stipulating the methodology used. The court could not intervene on the technicalities involved and the fact that the Tribunal had not given importance to the points raised by the applicant, did not mean that the court had the authority to force the Tribunal to take them into consideration. The court therefore rejected the plaintiff’s appeal and confirmed the Environment and Planning Tribunal’s decision, while ordering the plaintiff to bear court expenses.",Maltese,

However, when she sought to register her birth certificate in Malta, her father’s surname was erroneously written as “Camelleri” instead of “Camilleri” and the same error was repeated in the section which dealt with the child’s details. The plaintiff produced a translation from Arabic of both her original birth certificate and that of her father, both of which indicated that the family’s surname is indeed “Camilleri” – a relatively common surname on the Maltese Islands. The plaintiff requested the court to carry out the changes necessary while holding the defendant accountable for the error by making him bear all the related court expenses. The defendant noted that he was bound by law to copy into the registry word-for-word the details as indicated on the original birth certificates. The defendant handed to the court the translations presented by the plaintiff when she had originally sought to register her birth in Malta and her family’s surname had been written as “Camelleri”. He was bound to input the data as it was and therefore no error had been committed on his end, meaning that he was not to bear any financial burden.

The bank explained that they had provided a Swiss company with a loan totaling 70M USD in order to finance the acquisition of petroleum products and its relative sale. The agreement stipulated that part of the diesel oil acquired would be pledged in the plaintiff’s favour and stored at a third party’s site, only to be released upon their written consent. The defendant, famed as one of the best companies involved in transport and transshipment in the Caspian region, was the company charged with storage of 1,454,645 metric tons of the product, which was valued at almost 1.5 million USD. The defendant issued a “storage warrant” with which they obliged themselves to store the petroleum product, to which they had no claim, and release it only upon request of the bank. As it happened, the Swiss company registered economic difficulties and filed for bankruptcy, with the plaintiff’s unable to recoup the money lent. The defendant on the other hand, released the pledged petroleum product without authorization from the plaintiff, with the bank losing control of its security interest and not being able to determine its location. The plaintiff said that they were eligible for damages because the defendant company had violated its contractual obligations of storing the product unless instructed otherwise. The defendant rebutted that diesel oil had not been in their physical possession as they were not licensed to store such products in Makhachkala and which was instead located at a third party facility, rendering them not liable for any losses incurred. It also claimed that the plaintiff had not responded to correspondence in which they had warned the plaintiff that by Russian law they could not store the merchandise for much longer and would soon need to release it. Having received no guidance on their part, the defendant interpreted it as a case of forfeiture and was left with no other option but to release the stored product. Had they not done so it would have resulted in the confiscation of the merchandise and had they had any other option they would have gladly stored it because the Swiss company had debt of its own towards them and they would have recovered part of it through the sale of the petroleum product. The Russian Embassy in Malta confirmed the defendant claims regarding the existence and applicability of said law, saying that diesel oil could only be temporarily stored for two months and this could be extended to a maximum of four. The court found that the defendant’s claim of not being in physical possession of the product was in conflict to the “storage warrant” they had signed and in which they bound themselves not to release the product unless instructed to do so by the plaintiff. The court also found it hard to believe that the defendant had notified the plaintiff beforehand, saying that the letters they presented to substantiate their claims differed to their other correspondence, in the sense that they lacked the customary format and company stamp. In addition, it made no sense for the plaintiff to ignore such correspondence considering their vested interests in the matter and their previous timely replies. Also, considering the importance that the defendant company had in the sector, the court found it hard to believe that they had not been aware of Russian law on the matter, and even if that was the case, it was their responsibility to remain abreast of all legislation on the matter while informing the plaintiff of all legal requirements. The court therefore acceded to the plaintiff’s request and declared the defendant responsible for the loss of the pledged product because it had failed to adhere to its contractual obligations. The court ordered the defendant to pay the bank damages to the sum of 911,499.33 euros, based on the conversion rate on the day the product was released.

The plaintiffs explained that the minor’s father was a Russian national and that in Russian tradition it was customary for the surname to indicate the gender of the child. Therefore, the father’s surname would be added an ""-a” when attributed to a female. The plaintiffs brought as an example that the minor girl’s paternal grandmother whose surname in her passport was indeed with an ""-a"" at the end. The plaintiffs claimed that the girl had always been known by the female surname, both locally and especially among the Russian community. They requested the court to grant the necessary changes to the minor’s birth certificate and all civil documents. The defendant Director of Public Registry said that he had no objection, granted that no blame was attributed to him. He explained that in the year 2000, the year the child was born, the birth registration system did not contemplate a section in which a surname was given to a newborn and it was automatically given the surname of the father.

The parties had been married sixteen years and had a daughter. The couple, both Russian nationals, had resided in their family home of Moscow, but during the marriage the defendant had bought an apartment in, Malta. The plaintiff claimed that he had done so behind her back while not informing the notary that he was married and thus the title of the property was entirely in his name. The apartment had only been used by the family as a vacation home until the last years of the marriage when the family had moved to their Maltese apartment. After obtaining the divorce it had become the primary residence of the plaintiff and their daughter. Twenty years after obtaining the divorce, the parties were involved in a number of ongoing proceedings both in Malta and Russia. Some involved the payment of past unpaid maintenance fees, while others involved the selling of the Moscow apartment the couple shared and which was sold off by the defendant without prior approval from her ex-husband. Fearing a similar situation, the plaintiff requested the court to grant an injunction against the defendant in order to stop him from selling the Malta apartment. The plaintiff said that the Family Law Code of the Russian Federation was identical to the Maltese equivalent and stated that anything bought during marriage belonged to the couple in each measure. The injunction therefore served to prohibit the defendant from selling the plaintiff’s sole residence from behind her back, something he could in theory do because the housing registry listed him as sole owner of the residence with no mention of the plaintiff. If sold to third parties before the end of the proceedings the plaintiff might risk having no claim to the said property. The defendant argued that he was sole owner of the apartment because he had bought it with funds donated to him by his mother. He said that the plaintiff at the time had been fully aware of this fact and had not accompanied him to buy the property, neither did she hand him a power of attorney, and only many years later did she lay claim to the property. Not even after the divorce did the plaintiff request the court to grant her half-ownership of the apartment and the defendant produced the legal opinion of a Russian-based law firm which said that in Russian Law there existed a prescriptive three-year term which commenced on the obtainment of a divorce decree, during which period the division of matrimonial assets had to occur. However, the plaintiff had only raised the issue of the apartment many years later and he produced the witness account of his own brother who confirmed that their mother had provided the defendant with the funds required for acquiring the house. The court listed a number of preconditions required prior to granting an injunction. It made it clear that the granting or refusal of an injunction did not signify that a claim had been proven or disproven. It was not this Court’s duty to delve into the merits, but an injunction was simply a preventive action which was issued before the merit had been determined. It is issued if at first glance the claim is considered credible, believable or plausible. The court noted how Russian’s Separation of Assets was very similar to local law on the matter and stipulated that everything acquired during marriage belonged to both parties in equal measure. This meant that the plaintiff’s claim to the property might be valid and so was the risk that the defendant might sell the property before the courts decided on the matter. The damage the plaintiff would suffer would be irreparable, an issue rendered even more important by the fact that it was her sole residence. The court therefore decided that prima facie the plaintiff’s fears were well founded. The court therefore acceded to the plaintiff’s request and granted the injunction in her favour, with court expenses borne by the defendant.",Maltese,

In front of the lower court the defendant objected to the statements of three witness from being reproduced because at the time of their interrogation they were co-accused with the defendant. The latter quoted the Laws of Malta which stipulated that a confession did not serve as evidence against anyone except against those who make the confessions. In addition, prior to the amendment carried out a few years prior, Article 639 of the Criminal Code had stipulated that when the sole witness against the defendant was his accomplice, his statement alone would not suffice for the defendant to be found guilty. The defendant also put in doubt the validity of the statements saying that the witnesses did not comprehend the Maltese language yet no expert translator had been called and so they were assisted by unknown third parties with dubious competencies. Later during proceedings, a lawyer was called to carry out the translation of the same statements from English to Maltese. The defendant argued that the lawyer in question lacked qualifications as an interpreter or linguist and therefore his nomination breached the relevant dispositions in Maltese law. The defendant requested the expunge of a number of testimonies of police officers as hearsay and that of accusatory witness statements in separate proceedings since according to the defendant they did not conform with the standards imposed by law. The defendant also requested the extracted mobile data to be removed from the records because the person nominated to carry out the process did not have any specialization in telecommunication and had obtained the information directly from the service provider without receiving any authorisation from the police or courts. Finally, the defendant claimed that his rights had been breached when he was not giving the opportunity to counter-examine a particular witness because the lawyer had failed to turn up for proceedings, with the court declaring the evidence-gathering closed, thus precluding the defendant’s right to fair trial. The lower court had decided that the statements given to the police by those who at the time were co-accused with the defendant would not be presented to the jury but would instead serve as a means of control of the witness who might be confronted with their previous statements should their version of events in court differ from what they previously stated, or if they failed to turn up for subsequent court proceedings. The court also declared itself confused as to why the defendant quoted an outdated law which had years previously been amended to allow for witness statements of accomplices if they are the only witness against the accused. The court rejected the defendant’s claim that there had not been interpreters to assist during their witness statements. Moreover, the court argued it was normal court practice for lawyers to carry out the translation from English to Maltese and nobody could doubt a lawyer’s ability to carry out such a simple task. The court said that it was also normal practice for the court to introduce statements by police who might have obtained information from third parties. The court refused to decide upon the validity of statements given in other proceedings as those were to be decided upon by the Court of Appeal. The court also threw out the defendant’s attempt to discredit the technological expert, saying that the person in question was an IT. expert who was regularly appointed by the court and renowned in his area of competence. The modality of the obtainment of said documents would be decided upon during the proceedings. Finally, the court noted that the defendant’s lawyer had failed to notify the court why he had not been present to counter-examine the witness in question and therefore the court had every right to declare the gathering of evidence closed. The defendant would still have the opportunity to counter-examine during the trial. The defendant appealed these preliminary decisions on the same grounds. In particular noting that when the court had accepted that the co-accused witnesses’ statement should only serve as guarantee against the witnesses and should not be reproduced to the jury, the court erroneously rejected the defendant’s objections granting the prosecution great discretion on the matter. The court of criminal appeals accepted this latter claim and ordered that the witness statements could only be used against the witnesses during court proceedings. It however rejected all the objections raised by the defence, while reminding it that copious case law had concluded that not all reports of what third parties said constituted hearsay. The court ordered the case to be sent back to the lower court for the trial to commence.",Maltese,

The couple had met when the plaintiff was fifteen years old and the defendant was twenty-five years old and working in Malta as a football player. They married two years later by Muslim rites, in accordance to the defendant’s religious beliefs. Prior to celebrating nuptials, the defendant had made the plaintiff believe that he intended on having children but afterwards he repudiated the idea of having children with her. The plaintiff said that her husband had done everything in his power to avoid having children and the defendant himself admitted to the court that he did not wish to have children in Malta because he did not wish to raise children in a culture so foreign to his. The court accepted the defendant’s claim that the plaintiff had initially agreed to them not having children, but the court added that this did not mean that the marriage was not eligible for annulment.

The plaintiff explained that she had met the defendant while on holiday in Cuba with two of her cousins. An economics graduate, she worked as a Director in the family business while the Cuban defendant came from a poor family and, although trained as a barber, earned money by selling souvenirs to tourists. The plaintiff immediately felt attracted to him and he spent the rest of the holiday travelling with the three tourists. She bought him a mobile phone in order to maintain contact and went on to visit Cuba five times in the span of seven months. The plaintiff managed to secure a visa for the defendant to enter Malta and the parties married after a courtship of less than a year. She supported him financially, helping him to secure jobs and even financing the opening of his own barber shop. The plaintiff recounted that less than two years after marrying, the defendant’s mother called telling him that his grandmother was seriously ill. He left for Cuba and, even though he spent only ten days away from home, the defendant seemed different upon return. She accessed his social media profiles and noted that he had been in contact with a Spanish woman. When confronted, he admitted to having had a sexual relationship with her but rejected the plaintiff’s attempt to cut off all contact between him and the lover, with the defendant telling her that he could not promise to be loyal to her anymore. When she told him that she might be pregnant as they had been trying for children, the defendant told her that he did not mind the idea of travelling to visit them every so often. At that moment, the plaintiff realised that they did not have the same values on marriage and family life, and decided to oust her husband from the family household. She retained access to the security cameras in the defendant’s barber shop and saw the defendant having sexual relations with many foreign women, including the Spanish woman he had met in Cuba and who had then visited him in Malta. The plaintiff’s family members took part in proceedings and all confirmed that they had disapproved of the hurried marriage because they were a traditional family, while the defendant is from far away and had a different culture to theirs. They felt that the defendant had taken advantage of the plaintiff’s generosity and her mother was so opposed to the relationship that she did not even attend the couple’s wedding ceremony. The court found that the plaintiff had been blinded by her love for the defendant and this inhibited her from taking note of the words of caution issued by her family. On the other hand, the defendant was nothing more than a grifter who’s only goal was to live off the plaintiff and reside in Europe. The court made reference to the plaintiff’s collection of photos and messages which showed that the defendant, in the three months following the departure from the family household, had had intimate relations with at least ten different women in his shop. All this proved to the fact that not only did the defendant exclude marriage itself but also the essential element of fidelity in marriage.

In addition, she asked for sole care and custody of their only son, maintenance, dissolution and division of the community of acquests, and the right to reside, together with her son, in the family residence. The plaintiff explained that they had been married for four years but had spent the first part of their marriage in the defendant’s home country of Tunisia, before returning to Malta for the birth of their son. She said that the defendant travelled often to Tunisia and one day he called to inform his wife that he had married another woman and did not intend to return to Malta. Before absconding, he had racked up a considerable debt with a car dealership and utilities company with creditors who now sought to retrieve their due income from the plaintiff. She said that she had no say whatsoever in her husband’s business ventures but now found herself threatened to have her utilities at home severed if she did not cover for the defendant’s debts. The plaintiff said that the defendant used to work incessantly but provided little in terms of financial support, and since she did not hold employment of her own, she was forced to live off social benefits. It was with these funds that she bought the few possessions they had at their family dwelling, with the plaintiff saying that most of the marital assets had been acquired in the early period of their marriage while residing in Tunisia and were now in possession of the defendant. The plaintiff presented the statements of numerous family members who confirmed her version of events and said that the defendant was an aggressive person, known for drinking excessively and who rarely dedicated any time for his family. The plaintiff’s sister recounted how she had lent her sibling a telephone, which they did not possess in their own household, for her sister to plead with her husband to return to Malta in order to see his son, but to no avail. The court noted how unfortunately it was not the first case of a person coming from a different culture who abandoned their partners and children after mistreating them. It acceded to all of the plaintiffs demands and declared the personal separation due to reasons attributable to the defendant. It set the date he had abandoned the family as the day when he called his wife to inform her that he had remarried, a date antecedent to the debts he racked up. This meant that the defendant was solely responsible towards the creditors and, while he was entitled to the items bought during marriage and present in Tunisia, the plaintiff was handed the right to reside in the family residence and claim to all the possessions found within it. Care and custody was assigned entirely to the plaintiff, particularly because the defendant did not seem interested in sharing the responsibility.

The couple had met in the summer period and married one month after first making acquaintance. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant had promised to take care of her both emotionally and financially, and had found her in her most vulnerable at eight-months pregnant after a failed four-year relationship. The defendant, an Algerian national, had convinced the plaintiff to marry him without telling her that his visa expired at the end of the month and that marriage to a Maltese national permitted him to obtain freedom of movement in the country. The plaintiff’s family recognized the insincerity of the defendant’s claims and both her mother and sister gave witness in court saying that they had tried to convince her that she was committing a mistake. After the marriage, the defendant’s attitude changed completely and he started ignoring, mistreating and even being violent towards his wife. He used to justify himself by saying that in his culture he was permitted to do whatever he wanted to his wife. Apart from that, he kept on living a bachelor’s life which probably included even extra-marital affairs, while not providing any financial support to the plaintiff and even refusing to have sexual relations with her. The couple legally separated some two years after marrying, with the defendant returning to his home country. The court found that the case showed, without a shadow of doubt, that it was a marriage a convenience. The defendant simulated his consent to a marriage which permitted him to obtain movement and residency rights. The court said that while nullity refers to the moment marriage is contracted and therefore the moment leading to marriage are generally given greater importance, in this case the events that followed the nuptials were equally significant because they uncovered the real intentions of the parties. The defendant’s attitude following marriage showed that he lacked the consent necessary for entering marriage and had excluded a priori every essential element of marriage known in Malta, both for civil or religious marriages. The court argued that the plaintiff had clearly sweet-talked a vulnerable person into marrying him but the plaintiff was not without fault as she should have realized the dangers, especially when considering that she even had the benefit of close family members who had advised her to desist from going along with the marriage.

His attitude changed after marriage and the plaintiff recounted how he had continued living the bachelor’s life, drinking heavily and staying out till the early hours of the morning. She explained that she had tried to ask him why he left her alone in order to go out with his friends and he responded by saying that this was permissible in his culture and that his culture stipulated that a woman’s place was at house. The marital problems worsened when the plaintiff was told by a defendant’s co-worker that he had previously been married in his home country and was the father to three children.

The plaintiff said that she had been seventeen years old when she had celebrated a Muslim marriage with the defendant and the marriage had subsequently been registered in his home country of Jordan. She said that the couple had never lived together and the marriage had never been consummated. In fact, at the time she lived with her then boyfriend and after marrying she continued residing with him. The plaintiff explained that she had been introduced to the defendant by her mother’s ex-husband and her immaturity made her an easy target for manipulation. Her mother was undergoing treatment for depression and could not advise her properly, while her father was absent from her life. She said that without knowing she found herself married and that she last saw the defendant on the day they registered the marriage. At no point had they discussed about children and marriage and at no moment did they cohabit as a married couple. She claimed that the defendant’s sole motive had been to obtain Maltese citizenship and benefit from the rights this brought. The defendant agreed that the marriage was deserving of annulment but rejected the idea that he had manipulated the defendant in anyway and the marriage had failed for reasons attributable exclusively to the plaintiff. He said that plaintiff had been well aware of what she was getting herself into and, prior to marrying, the plaintiff and her mother had done the necessary paperwork to facilitate his re-entry into Malta following his visit to Jordan to see his ailing father. No undue pressure had occurred on the plaintiff, even because the plaintiff’s ex-stepfather no longer lived with her mother and therefore was in no position of power over the teenage girl. In addition, he presented a form the plaintiff had submitted to the social service department, in which she applied for marriage benefits. He said that being underage, she had sought and obtained permission from her parents to marry. He rejected the notion that he had married to obtain citizenship rights, saying that he had been residing in Malta ten years and it would not have made any sense to marry after such a long elapse of time. The defendant said that in his culture it was normal to marry after a brief courtship. Jordanian culture, he explained, stipulated the procedure required to enter marriage with the groom who must ask his father to speak to the bride’s counterpart in order to set up the marriage contract and that no contact between the couple could occur before this was carried out. The defendant continued that this was one of the reasons why he had travelled to visit his father in Jordan. At the time, he was twenty-seven years old and knew perfectly well what marriage entailed and it ended up failing due to the plaintiff’s immaturity. The court started by saying the institution of marriage was an issue of public order and therefore merited special safeguards. In order for a marriage to be declared null, the court must be sufficiently convinced that the marriage had not occurred even though the ceremonial rites had been carried out. The court said that the plaintiff had failed to prove that consent had been extorted by violence or that they had lacked the discretion necessary, as both the plaintiff and her mother had had an active role in ensuring the defendant’s return from Jordan. In addition, the defendant claimed to have been well aware of the duties marriage brought with it and the plaintiff had not lacked discretion as she knew clearly well what financial benefits she could obtain through marriage. The fact that after marrying they had never lived together, coupled with the plaintiff’s return to her then boyfriend, did not mean that they did not know what marriage meant but simply that they had ulterior motives. The defendant wished to obtain Maltese citizenship and even though he had spent ten years in Malta the claim for citizenship would certainly have been facilitated by his marriage to a Maltese citizen, while on the other hand the plaintiff wished to obtain marriage benefits, thus contradicting her portrayal of a defenseless youth who had been taken advantage of by the defendant. The court said that the Law of Malta stipulated that marriages celebrated simply for obtainment of citizenship rights were classifiable as marriages of convenience. These marriages were illegal and the parties had made themselves liable for charges to be issued against them. The court therefore found that the marriage had never occurred and acceded to the plaintiff’s request by declaring the marriage null. It also ordered the sentence to be sent to the Police Commissioner for further investigation. Court expenses borne by both parties.",Maltese,

The couple married after a courtship of four months and from this marriage they had one daughter. The plaintiff explained that the defendant had never worked and was financially dependent on her both before and after marrying. She regularly insisted with him to find a job but, according to the plaintiff, he preferred spending the day sleeping and the evenings out with friends. The plaintiff said that her husband never provided neither for her nor for their child and oftentimes it was her mother who had to supply the basics for the minor and food for the plaintiff. She said that the marriage was characterised by threats and violence, often hitting his wife and tearing up the items of their infant, occasionally even threatening physical injury on the child. The plaintiff recalled that the first time he put his hands on her was when she confronted him and told him to start shouldering responsibility towards his family. He had fiercely attacked her, punching her in the face, tearing her clothes and kicking her, even if he knew perfectly aware that his wife was then two months pregnant. The defendant would travel often to his home country of Egypt, sometimes spending months on end, and took the plaintiff with him on two occasions. When he would travel alone, he would demand that his wife left the apartment they rented and live with her mother because he did not trust her on her own. These voyages were financed entirely by the plaintiff who at times sold some personal items in order to pay for the airplane tickets. The couple’s first time together in Egypt should have lasted one month but ended up being six, and the period was characterised by dire loneliness for the plaintiff who was constrained to her in-law’s apartment, while the defendant was constantly out with friends. The violence continued and it was during the second trip to Egypt, with the plaintiff ever more fearful that the defendant would hurt their daughter, that she decided to call her mother to buy her return tickets. She found a sympathy in the defendant’s father, who well aware of the plaintiff’s mistreatment by his son, tried his best to help her by shielding her from her husband, finding her a job and even taking her to the airport when she finally decided to leave Egypt. Upon arriving in Malta, she filed for personal separation because she felt that she could no longer trust her husband. After returning, she lost all contact with the defendant, who did not even attempt to maintain good relations with their child. The court said that the defendant had no idea what a married life consisted of, let alone the duties and obligations derived from it. It said that many might be surprised to hear of such mistreatment by a husband to his wife especially in a day and age when female emancipation has given women many rights recognised by law. However, domestic violence remained a reality and the court was often encountering instances of Maltese women mistreated by men arriving from different cultures. These mixed marriages were often a source of intimate partner violence and greater education and support networks were necessary to aid the victims, while stronger legislation was needed in order to stop such abuse from occurring. The defendant, the court continued, did not have the slightest idea of what was meant by marriage, particularly in the Maltese culture, and never acted as the plaintiff’s husband but only ever considered his own interests. He did not have the discretion necessary to enter marriage. The court concluded that the plaintiff must have been so infatuated by the defendant that she ignored the warning signs and that made it impossible for her to give valid consent and for her to understand the essential elements of the said marriage. The court therefore acceded to the plaintiff’s request and declared the marriage null, with court expenses divided between the parties.",Maltese,

The issue revolved around an order of 16,000 luxury cars ordered by pre-revolutionary government and of which only 5,250 had been actually delivered. In addition, the plaintiff claimed that the cars actually delivered had been of inferior quality to that agreed, while a portion had been erroneously sent to the Port of Misrata instead of Tripoli and had been stolen during the revolts. The order had totaled almost 70 million dollars and had been duly paid by the Bank. The court had previously refused to issue a garnishee orders but had acceded to the plaintiff’s request for an injunction. This injunction led to the freezing of the defendant’s assets. During the injunction proceedings the defendant requested the court to order the plaintiff to provide an adequate monetary guarantee for the payment of penalties that might be imposed, including relevant damages and interest, in the eventuality that the injunction was removed. The defendant alleged that the association the plaintiff claimed to represent was non-existent because it had been liquidated by the Libyan government after the fall of the Gaddafi. This meant that it had no judicial capacity to make any requests, with the plaintiff’s role as representative of the said association de facto terminated. The defendant made reference to a formal letter issued by the Libyan Embassy in Malta, addressed to the Maltese Ministry for Foreign Affairs, which had confirmed that the association the plaintiff said to represent no longer existed, apart from the fact that the plaintiff himself was a wanted man in Libya in connection with his dealing with the previous regime controlled by Colonel Muammar Gaddafi. In addition, the defendant claimed that most of the evidence presented by the plaintiff was of very dubious authenticity, leading a court in other proceedings to consider forwarding the evidence to the Police Commissioner in order to investigate the possibility of fraudulent behaviour. The defendant claimed that the plaintiff’s actions were abusive, in bad faith and fraudulent, and since he did not reside in Malta or have any assets linked to the country, this meant that financial guarantees in the defendant’s favour were in order in accordance to Maltese law. The court started by arguing that recourse for the provision of guarantees was an alternative to a request of removal of an injunction. For this to be accepted there needed to be a just cause meriting the placement of such guarantee. In this case however, the court felt that the fact that the plaintiff did not reside in Malta was not in itself a just cause and the defendant had failed to prove that the injunction had been issued abusively, that there was no prime facie basis for it to be issued or that the injunction had caused him to suffer any injustice. The fraud that the defendant claimed required in detailed study, a task which did not fall on this court’s shoulders, but on the court which was overseeing the injunction proceedings. The court therefore rejected the defendant’s request and ordered him to bear court expenses.",Maltese,

The couple, both Ethiopian nationals, had given birth to two children in Malta. Upon registration of their first newborn they had explained to the Registry that surnames or family names were not contemplated in Ethiopian culture and that in the East African country it was customary to use the father’s first name as the child’s last name. The plaintiffs explained that when their second child was born, the defendant Director of Public Registry had told them that due to a change in policy, the department could only register the child in accordance to Maltese law which stipulated that a newborn had to take the father’s surname. This meant that their second child was registered with the siblings having different surnames. The plaintiff claimed that it was in their interest for the siblings to have the same surname and requested the court to order the defendant to change the surname of their eldest child. The defendant said that the details had been registered in accordance to the plaintiff’s declaration and that no error had occurred. The plaintiff had been given the opportunity to review the particulars before signing to it and therefore the defendant should not be held responsible for any court expenses. The court said that even though the plaintiffs provided evidence to prove the customs in Ethiopia in regard to naming tradition, the children were born in Malta and therefore had to be registered in accordance to Maltese Law which did not allow for changes in surnames due to wishes or culture. The court said that it found it difficult to believe the plaintiff’s claim that the Public Registry had a policy which went against Maltese Law and which had allowed them to register their first child with the father’s name as surname. The plaintiffs had also failed to provide any proof to the veracity of their claim.

While registering the birth of their child, the plaintiffs had made use of the opportunity to give him the surnames of both parents. The problem, the plaintiffs said, was that in Bulgarian culture the surname was made to indicate if the offspring is of male or female sex. Thus, while the Bulgarian mother has a surname ending with an ‘a’, her son should have had his surname written without it to indicate he is a male. The plaintiff said the defendant had told them that Maltese law did not allow for changes in the surname and that their son’s surname had to be identical to the one found on his mother’s civil documents. The plaintiffs stressed that the change was necessary as it risked precluding the child from obtaining Bulgarian citizenship and therefore impeding the family’s desire of relocating to Bulgaria. To prove her case, the mother presented her own birth certificate and the couple’s marriage certificate, both of which listed her father, the child’s grandfather, as having the male version of the surname. The plaintiffs also presented the statement of the President of the Bulgarian - Maltese Cultural Association who confirmed that Bulgarian surnames followed an Eastern European tradition of having a surname which consisted of the family name, with the last letter indicating the sex of the child. The defendant said that while he did not doubt that in Bulgaria a different tradition existed in this regard, he stressed that he was bound by Maltese Law which did not contemplate any changes in surname upon registration. The court felt that the plaintiffs had succeeded in proving their case, not only that Bulgarian naming tradition differed to that in Malta, but also that failing to make the necessary amendments would create problems to the minor when it came to travelling to his mother’s home country. The court argued that while the law was very rigid when it came to changing surnames so as to protect the interests of third parties, it felt that the case in hand did not require an actual change in surname, but rather the removal of a letter which served to indicate the sex of a child. Correction of this anomaly was warranted in order to safeguard the interests of the child. The court therefore acceded to plaintiffs’ request and ordered the defendant to carry out the necessary changes in the minor’s birth certificate. Court expenses born by the plaintiffs.",Maltese,

The plaintiff was a young waitress undergoing economic difficulties, when a Russian friend introduced her to a group of Arabic men. These men often spoke of the problematics related to the renewal of their work permits in Malta and how they faced unpleasant situations such as being called generic names like “Johnny”, “Charlie” and “Tony”. They hinted to the fact that if they married a Maltese woman, all their problems would fade away. At first, the idea did not interest the plaintiff but later her friend told her that she had heard of a Maltese woman who prepared all of the marriage arrangements and paid the consenting women the sum of 500 Maltese lira (€1165). The plaintiff started to warm up to the idea, especially because she was told that all she had to do was sign the papers in the Registry and that it was not required for her to live with her eventual husband. A short while later, the Plaintiff recalled that the defendant, a young Arab whose name she could not remember, had approached her and opened up about his visa problems, offering to pay her in exchange for marrying him. He showed her a lump of cash and offered to pay her half upfront and the rest after the deed was finalised. Following an initial period of hesitation, the plaintiff agreed to the arrangement on the condition that they never lived together. It was Christmas time and she insisted that they wait until after the holiday period. She explained that the defendant was annoyed because he was afraid of being deported at any day. At the turn of the year, she met the defendant in front of the Public Registry who she found in the company of two of his friends who would serve as witnesses. After they finished, the defendant handed the plaintiff the rest of the money he had promised and she never saw him again. Things remained unchanged for five months when the defendant called and informed her that they had been called to the Police Headquarters. They tried to form a consistent argument but upon interrogation the plaintiff’s nerve broke and she started crying, immediately admitting to the authorities that the marriage had been arranged. A police inspector took part in the proceedings and explained that marriages of convenience had been outlawed that year and that criminal charges had been issued against the couple and numerous other Maltese nationals who had married Arab men. The plaintiff had been released after a few hours but pled guilty in court and was sentenced to one-year imprisonment suspended for three years. The defendant on the other had been remanded in custody and later deported. The court said that it was clear that it was a case of marriage of convenience with the defendant remaining in Malta through deceit. There could be no doubt that the parties had excluded and completely simulated marriage itself.

The order is a self-styled, unrecognized order which sought to emulate the Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of Saint John of Jerusalem, of Rhodes and of Malta which is a Catholic lay religious order, traditionally of military, chivalric and noble nature. It had ruled Malta for more than 250 years between the years 1530 and 1798 and, even though it presently held no territory, it was still considered as sovereign entity of international law, with diplomatic relations with many countries. The plaintiff said that the defendant, an Italian national, had fraudulently and through the falsification of documents, presented himself as the legitimate Grandmaster with banks, governmental entities and Ministries in order to obtain official recognition. The plaintiff said that he had also made use of funds belonging to the Order and had already been condemned in the Italian Court on a separate case of document falsification and usurpation of titles. The defendant rejected these claims by saying that the plaintiff had been unanimously removed from his position of Grandmaster by the order’s general assembly, because he had been found guilty of abusing his position by granting diplomatic passports, which were both illegal and prohibited by the order. The defendant said that in turn he had been unanimously elected as the Grandmaster and therefore had every right to represent the Order’s administrative interests. He argued that the plaintiff had no right to speak in the name of the Order and had no judicial interest to institute proceedings. The plaintiff rejected the defendant’s claims that he had been found guilty by an Italian court, saying that he had been liberated on Appeal. In addition, the defendant said that according to the Law of Malta, the courts had no jurisdiction to decide upon matters of nobility titles, honours or foreign honorary titles. The court agreed with the defendant in that the court had the obligation not to recognize the existence of titles or honours not written in law. The court argued the title of Grandmaster was neither a local honour, nor was it a title conferred by a State or sovereign order in diplomatic relations with Malta. Therefore, the court had the duty to take no action which could give legitimacy to these titles, and if it were to arrive to the conclusion that the plaintiff’s claims were substantiated, it would be going against the law which categorically forbid the courts from recognizing the existence of these titles. The court rejected the plaintiff’s claim that it was too late in proceedings to decide on the admissibility of the case and said that it was a matter of public policy and therefore admissible at any stage in the proceedings. The court said that it had initially permitted proceedings to continue because it had wished that this objection first be raised by the defendant and not by the court.

The plaintiff introduced itself as a company that over the past years had instituted itself as a household name in the area of jewellery, with a distinct and unique concept inspired by elements of Maltese identity; like Maltese tiling, history, art and cultural heritage. In order to do so it had invested a lot of time, research and funds which totalled millions of euros, and this led to the creation of numerous outlets and online platforms selling merchandise worldwide. The plaintiff had managed to gain access to the cached website the defendants intended to launch in the near future, and they accused it of planning to sell an identical line of products, with an identical concept and which in most cases even had nearly identical nomenclature. The defendant had even gone so far as to copy the terms and conditions of their soon-to-be-unveiled website word-for-word to that of the plaintiff’s established online platform. Incidentally, the defendant’s main trade was in the catering industry and their sudden venture into jewellery was ever more suspect. The plaintiff recounted a recent event it had hosted and for which they utilized the defendant’s catering services. On that day, the plaintiff said, representatives of the defendant company had shown exaggerated and suspicious interest in the plaintiff’s business venture. The defendant’s actions constituted obvious and evident breach of intellectual rights, including copyright, as well as illicit and unfair competition which risked causing great confusion on the market. The defendant objected saying that the plaintiff’s actions were hurried and premature based on the cached version of a site that was not even yet online. The defendant explained how they were a catering company famous for focusing on traditional Maltese food and they had sought to diversify their business by focusing on a long-standing passion for jewellery, but with the same intent of focusing on a distinct Maltese style. They described it as a work-in-progress and claimed to be surprised with the plaintiff’s injunction request because the company’s Board of Directors still had to approve the style they would utilize and there was no certainty regarding the products they would end up selling. The defendant said that it was unclear what rights the plaintiff was trying to protect, as they had failed to reference which design or exclusive property they feared being copied, and which copyright infringement they were envisaging. They also reassured the court that a number of jewellery collection names which the plaintiff had found to be identical were going to change by launch date and so would the terms and conditions of their website. The defendant reiterated the plaintiff’s request for recourse was disproportionate, based on a cached website that was still bound to undergo several amendments and refinements. The court explained that an injunction is an extraordinary procedural action granted if at prima facie it was proven that the plaintiff had rights which required protection. In this case, the plaintiff could not claim that the defendant had copied their brand because their own products still needed to be launched and their designs are not yet known. The court also noted the defendant had committed themselves to altering the names of some of their final products, so as to ensure that no copyright infringement occurred. The plaintiff’s actions were untimely, as it was not yet ascertained if the defendant’s jewellery style will be any similar or would contain any characteristics or elements comparable to the plaintiff’s own designs. The element of prima facie was lacking because from the proof produced it was not clear which copyright claims the plaintiff wished to enforce. It was unfair to request that the defendant simply desisted from diversifying the business by entering the jewellery sphere, because as the things stood there was no prove that it would be acting improperly or selling products which might be confused with the plaintiff’s designs. The latter would have to wait until the final launch in order to get a better understanding of the defendant’s ideas, while being in a position to better motivate their claims should they decide to retake action. The court therefore rejected the plaintiff’s request for an injunction and ordered it to bear court expenses.",Maltese,

The plaintiff was a bus driver employed with the defendant company for two years and, after a number of misconduct reports, he was handed a gross misconduct charge and told to attend a disciplinary hearing. The plaintiff had told the Tribunal that the date on the letter he received erroneously read 9:45pm, when in actual fact it was held in the morning. His absence meant that he was confirmed guilty and the case considered closed, without him being given the opportunity to defend himself. The plaintiff explained that the gross misconduct he was accused of was when he obeyed company directives of not driving while tired and rested in the vehicle for a short period. He said that at the time he was working considerable number of overtime hours and had acted responsibly by resting so as not to danger his life and that of his passengers. This meant that he had started the voyage 20 minutes later than stipulated, leading to his claim of unfair dismissal. The plaintiff also alleged that the defendant company had acted in a discriminatory fashion because the company doctor would often refuse to accept his claims of illness and accuse him of feigning. The defendant told the Tribunal that the offences committed by the plaintiff were serious and his dismissal was thus justified by law. It presented all the warnings the plaintiff had been given prior to his dismissal, while saying that all the necessary procedures had been followed and that the plaintiff had had numerous avenues for recourse which he had decided not to utilise. In addition, it said that the plaintiff’s excuse that he had been incorrectly notified of when the disciplinary hearings would be held did not hold water, because it was reasonable to assume that a hearing would not be held in the middle of the night, and at no moment did he approach Human Resources to clarify the error. The defendant said that apart from these gross misconduct charges, the plaintiff had also received two other charge letters for arriving 90 minutes late for work without any justification and for damaging the bus during a minor accident. The Tribunal had found that while the defendant company had sufficient reason to dismiss the plaintiff, it felt that it was its duty to consider the context and the reality of situation from all angles. It noted that the plaintiff was a refugee who needed to understand and internalise both the operational and the administrative rules of the company. Being a migrant, this might prove more arduous not only due to linguistic barriers, but the mere systems of grievance procedures, fair hearings, work place counselling and membership in a trade union might be concepts totally alien to him. The Tribunal decided that most refugees do not experience social sophistication and the plaintiff had faced challenges in navigating his way through the administrative procedures of the company. The Tribunal said that the company failed to appreciate migrant limitations at the linguistic and cultural level. The employee must be in a position to understand the process but also the way and means with which he was allowed to defend himself and the implications that the disciplinary proceedings might have on his employment. The Tribunal therefore had found the defendant company guilty for failing to provide any evidence that they had spared any time or effort to counsel the plaintiff and explain to him that he risked being dismissed if his behaviour continued. The defendant took to the Court of Appeal saying that the Tribunal’s judgement was illogical and did not follow legal guidelines regarding unfair dismissals. The decision was contradictory because while the Tribunal had found that the appellant had followed procedures and that its actions had been justified, it still judged the dismissal to be unfair and awarded damages. In addition, it had taken into consideration and based its final decision upon aspects which were not raised by the parties. The Tribunal’s dubious line of reasoning meant that it based its decision upon the assumption that the plaintiff, being an Ethiopian national, had inferior comprehension abilities than other persons. The appellant company therefore requested the Court of Appeal to overturn the Tribunal’s decision and declare that the plaintiff’s dismissal was justified and did not merit compensation. The court found that the plaintiff had been given extensive training before commencing employing and that during his deposition in front of the Tribunal he had spoken in clear English, thus weakening the thesis that there were any language barriers. In addition, he had been offered legal counsel which he had refused. The court said there was no evidence to prove that the plaintiff’s dismissal was unjustified and instead the Tribunal carried out conjectures and generalisations which did not result from the parties’ depositions. The Tribunal should have judged on the facts, even because the plaintiff had failed to prove his claim that he had been discriminated against. The appellant had followed all the procedures stipulated by the collective agreement and therefore the court acceded to all of appellant’s requests, while ordering court expenses to be borne by the plaintiff who did not take part in the appeal.",Maltese,

The plaintiff explained that he was a registered street hawker, with permits to sell food, beverages and tobacco products. He exercised this right by means of a kiosk which he parked inside a car park at Marsaskala and which fell under the remit of the local council. He said that he had paid the latter council for postal service and permits which allowed him to place four tables and umbrellas in an area of seven square metres. When the defendant government agency, responsible for land use and planning in Malta, notified him that his actions were irregular, he sought to regularize himself by applying for the relevant permits. When he was issued with the financial penalty, he sought recourse with the courts because according to him his actions could not be classified as development because the kiosk had wheels and was not a permanent fixture. He therefore asked the court to declare that the defendant’s claim is untrue in fact and in law and that the fine imposed was null and without executive authority. The Authority said that it had taken action after receiving a complaint that the plaintiff had permanently parked a stall in a public car park and surrounded it with tables and chairs, which in turn impinged on a public walkway. The defendant made its verifications and confirmed the claims to be veracious, with the plaintiff’s actions amounting to change in use of land and development without permit. The defendant noted that the plaintiff could not use the courts for recourse against an enforcement notice issued by the competent Authority and had he wanted he had every right to appeal the decision in front of the Environment and Planning Review Tribunal. Upon receiving an Enforcement Order, a person had to stop from all activity and return the site to its original state within sixteen days. The plaintiff had failed to lodge an appeal and instead had resorted to filing a development application in order to regularize his position, as was within his right. However, the Authority had rejected his application for development on public land and the financial penalties accumulated when the plaintiff refused to remove the illegalities. He eventually only obeyed the directives thirty-two months after receiving the Enforcement Order. The court took note of the evidence which included the plaintiff’s hawker permit and forty-five permits issued by the local council for the setting up of a kiosk. The court said that it was worrying how the local council had issued the same permit every three days for almost five months; a permit which was intended for temporary stalls typical during Maltese feasts and cultural activities. These temporary arrangements, the court continued, did not substitute permits issued by the defendant Authority which had every right to consider use of public land for commercial purposes as development as stipulated by the relevant legislation. The plaintiff could not appeal the enforcement notice in this court because there was nothing irregular with the defendant’s actions. Instead of instituting court proceedings, the plaintiff should have removed the irregularities and only did so many months after being told that his actions were illegal, even though the legal letter had clearly stipulated the accumulative fines imposed for failure to comply. The court therefore rejected the plaintiff’s requests and ordered him to bear court expenses.",Maltese,

The plaintiff described herself in the past as being a rebellious teenager, who had detested the strict nature of both her school and household. Once she reached adulthood, she obtained new-found freedoms and lived a licentious lifestyle, firmly intending on doing all the things she felt she had missed on in the previous years. At nineteen she had met in a bar the defendant, an Indian national, and while dating they spent a lot of time in the company of two couples known to the defendant. The plaintiff described these couples’ marriage as unorthodox who had the sole intention of enjoying themselves and would often not do so in the company of each other. It was a very carefree attitude which the plaintiff said influenced her, in the sense that she came to believe that marriage need not necessarily be characterised by sacrifices or responsibilities. One of these couples was fully immersed in Indian culture of smoking Indian cigarettes, burning Indian incense, eating their traditional food and listening to desi music. The plaintiff said that the defendant had promised her a similar lifestyle that they could get married and would not have to make compromises or restrict their liberties. During this period, the subject of marriage started being introduced but at this point they did not discuss the future or the possibility of children. The plaintiff said that she had noted that after meeting her parents, the defendant seemed much more resolute to marry, maybe motivated by the realisation that her parents were financially well-off. The plaintiff rejected the defendant’s attempts to marry until she fell pregnant, at which point the couple agreed to celebrate the nuptials as quickly as possible. The couple married and their son was born some five months later. The couple moved to an apartment but financial difficulties, due to irregular jobs and failed business ventures, forced the couple to return to her parent’s house on more than one occasion. They relocated to Bahrein, and later to Egypt, where the defendant had told her that he had numerous job opportunities. After returning to Malta with her son for a short period, in order to give her husband the opportunity to settle in Egypt, the plaintiff found it ever more difficult to maintain contact with the defendant. She did not know his whereabouts and contact was limited to a minimum. After a number of months, it became clear that the defendant had abandoned the family and the plaintiff considered the marriage over about 18 months after marrying. The plaintiff’s parents took part in the proceedings and said that they had never approved of the marriage, citing immaturity on the part of their daughter and the defendant who, apart from cultural differences, did not seem entirely sincere. They admitted of giving their daughter’s husband various sums of money for his business ventures, the largest of which amounted to 35,000 Maltese Lira (€81,528), and in hindsight believe that the defendant had only married because he had realised that it would be financially beneficial to him. The court felt that the defendant had not been honest about his intentions and only married the plaintiff for the financial support of her parents, and most probably used the pregnancy as a means to reach this goal. The plaintiff on the other hand was immature and ill-prepared for marriage, believing that it was all fun and games as though she could get out of it at any moment. The court said that this concept of the transitory nature of marriage was unfortunately a common concept in today’s society, probably intensified by an inadequate preparation for marriage which was not being given the importance it deserved. A lot of emphasis was being placed on a life of enjoyment and luxury, without giving the necessary time and space for the couples to fully comprehend the life of reciprocal dedication which they were entering of a permanent and indissoluble life which left no room for egoisms. In this case, said the court, it was clear that the defendant’s consent had been simulated. The court therefore acceded to the plaintiff request and declared the marriage null, with court expenses divided between the parties.",Maltese,

The two siblings had entered Malta at the ages of 16 and 18 respectively and upon landing immediately applied for refugee protection. They explained that their family was deeply involved in political activity in their home country of Armenia with their father who had been assassinated by Armenian Police and his sister – the applicant’s aunt – who had fled with her daughter and sought refuge in the United Kingdom after her husband and his mother had been murdered during inter-communal fighting involving Armenian and Azeri communities. This occurred when the political party against which the family had struggled had assumed executive power in Armenia following the elections held towards the end of the millennium. The police were an important tool of executive power of any state and their father’s assassination due to his political activity amounted to persecution on political grounds, and it was unlikely that the Armenian state would be willing or able to protect the plaintiffs’ personal security in the event of deportation to their home country. The plaintiffs’ refugee application however had been dismissed by the Refugee Commissioner and subsequently by the Refugee Appeals tribunal. They had opened proceedings in front of the lower court arguing that this risked violating Sections 33(1), 36(1) and 43 of the Constitution of Malta which stipulate that every person was entitled to the protection of their life, that no person should be subject to inhumane treatment and that no state could deport a person to a country where their life would be in danger. The defendants Minister of Home Affairs and Principal Immigration Officer objected to the request saying that the court proceedings were nothing more than a tactic to delay the applicants’ deportation from Malta. They pointed out the competent authorities in these matters were the Commissioner for Refugees and the Refugees Appeals Board who had found that there was no evidence to substantiate the applicant’s claims. While they had recounted some events which happened to their family members and which they had failed to adequately prove, there were no credible grounds to believe that the siblings would be subject to breaches of fundamental human rights. The defendants said that the Republic of Armenia was a State with a democratic Constitution and a member of the Council of Europe and therefore had ratified the European Convention on Human Rights. The lower court had rejected the plaintiff’s requests citing an improved political and human rights situation in Armenia since the events cited in their application. The plaintiff appealed the sentence claiming that the lower court had made a wrong assessment and appreciation of the evidence and further reiterated the belief that deportation of the applicants to Armenia would expose them to the inhumane and degrading treatment accorded to their aunt, and place their lives in manifest jeopardy, similar to that faced by their deceased father. The Constitutional Court started by saying that Section 43 of the Constitution was not applicable as that dealt with extradition requests and not deportation. The court then delved into the political situation of Armenia which was very unstable when it was transitioning from being a republic of the Soviet Union to a member of the Council of Europe. The late nineties and early years of the new millennium saw important political, social and economic upheaval and, although better, it still faced a number of problems. The court felt that the appellant had not provided sufficiently strong evidence to confirm that they faced specific, personal and significant risk of ill-treatment amounting to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. While prepared to accept that their aunt was politically active in Armenia in the late nineties, there was no evidence that she had been granted humanitarian protection in the UK. On the other hand, the circumstances of the appellant’s father’s death were not entirely clear and even though the death certificate presented stated that he had died due to injuries inflicted upon by the police, in their statements the plaintiffs had told to Refugee Commissioner that he had been beaten and rendered an invalid, but succumbed when his health deteriorated due to haematological complications. The disappearance of the applicants’ mother and two sisters did not seem linked and was probably a case of abandonment. Similarly, the appellants’ decision to leave Armenia did not seem to be caused by any imminent or clear risk of danger but seemed to be motivated by the wish to live in better circumstances, similar to those experienced by their aunt in the UK. They were never politically active and they only complained of oppression for religious reasons when they had been believed to be Muslim when in actual fact they were Christian. The court therefore rejected the appeal and ordered each party to bear its own costs.",English,

The plaintiff was a Nigerian national. Her father was a prominent member of the local political party ‘People Democratic Party’ and had been accused of stealing money belonging to the party. Her parents had died in a car accident which was a suspected murder and she started receiving death threats too. The following year, the house the plaintiff shared with her partner at the time, was destroyed by a bomb which killed their two-year-old daughter. The couple fled Nigeria and crossed the Mediterranean by boat where they arrived in Malta and subsequently applied for asylum. The plaintiff had obtained refugee status but the dramatic events took the toll on the plaintiff who was admitted to hospital for physiatrist help and, upon discharge, had unsuccessfully sought to locate her partner. In the years since, the plaintiff had started a new life and had a child with another Nigerian man in Malta. She had attempted to register her marriage with the defendant Director of Public Registry but had been told that this was not possible because she had been listed as already married to her previous partner. The plaintiff told the court that during the application process for obtainment of refugee status, due to the stress they were under and the language barriers they faced, there must have been a misunderstanding and the couple had been erroneously listed as married, when in actual fact they were simply cohabiting. The interview had occurred only a week after arriving on the Island and the plaintiff was still recovering from the trauma and stress of both the loss of her child and of the dangerous voyage while crossing the Mediterranean, and should be forgiven for any mistake in declaration she might have committed. She therefore requested the court to declare that she was never married, affirm her surname of birth and grant her permission to marry her present partner. The defendant objected to the plaintiff’s requests saying that there were no civil documents that needed to be amended and that the documents, referred to the plaintiff as containing erroneous information, were those created during her asylum application and which were not considered civil documents. In addition, the plaintiff’s version was not credible because both she and her then partner had both declared and reiterated to being married. They had both done so during the preliminary questionnaire, during the application process and even in the interview carried out by the Refugee Commissioner. It was improbable that both persons had made the same mistake in three different occasions and no one should be allowed to capriciously amend the information provided six year prior just because their personal circumstances had changed. The court agreed with the defendant’s objections and said that the court could not find a legal justification for the current proceedings as documents issued by the Office of the Refugee Commissioner were not classifiable as civil documents. Apart from that, the plaintiff had failed to prove that the information she disputed was incorrect and in fact the direct parties had confirmed its veracity on multiple occasions. The court explained that if the plaintiff had really never been married, she should have provided the necessary documentation and applied with the defendant Director for the relevant procedures to be carried out. If however she was indeed married she should have initiated proceedings with the family court in order to obtain a personal separation or divorce. The court therefore rejected the plaintiff’s requests and ordered her to bear all court expenses, which were to remain exempt from tax due to her particular circumstances.",Maltese,

The plaintiffs, all nine from Mali, had irregularly entered the country during the span of seven years. They were considered prohibited migrants according to the Migration Act and upon their arrival were placed in detention and later handed a removal order. They made a claim for asylum which was rejected at which point a delegation from Mali arrived in Malta in view of identifying the plaintiffs and issuing them with documents for their return. To aid in the process the plaintiffs had been remanded in custody for a number of months. Although the delegation from Mali had succeeded in identifying the plaintiffs, they had never provided the local authorities with their documentation. The plaintiffs took to court claiming that the removal order issued breached of the 1951 Refugee Convention, their detention had been abusive in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights as well as the Constitution. The lower court had noted that all plaintiffs had already previously been detained, with some who had even spent the maximum period of 18 months in detention before being released. While the defendants claimed that their re-arrest was permissible in view of their removal order, the arrest could certainly not be said to have occurred to avoid the plaintiffs from entering the country illegally because at that point they had already been living in Malta for a number of years. Neither could it be said that they were being detained in view of deportation or extradition because at that stage they were only undergoing interviews to aid in their identification. The lower court did not accept the defendant’s claim that had they not been arrested they would not have shown up for the interviews out of their own volition. The authorities had failed to determine beforehand whether any of the plaintiffs had already served the maximum detainment period and indeed two had already served the maximum eighteen-month period permitted by law. This meant that their detainment had been illegal, which was not justified especially after the plaintiffs were successfully identified. The court had noted how upon their re-arrest the plaintiffs had not been provided with any information regarding their arrest, making their eventual appeal difficult. In addition, they had not been provided with legal assistance and would not have received any had an NGO not interceded. And even then, their request to see the plaintiffs was only accepted after eight days. The lower court rejected the defendant’s claims that the present proceedings were an indication that effective remedies were available as one should not be forced to open lengthy constitutional proceedings in order to appeal unlawful detention. Finally, the court also declared that their eventual deportation was in breach of their rights as the plaintiffs had successfully integrated into society, had a stable employment, paid taxes and regularly extended their residency permits. The lower court had thus accepted all of the plaintiff’s claims, leading the defendant to appeal the decision in front of the constitutional court. The latter started by saying that for four of the plaintiffs their arrest had not occurred according to law because they had been issued with a removal order without a return order which was a necessary prerequisite for their detention. While refuting the lower court’s assertion that the defendant needed to initiate new proceedings in order to enforce a removal order, it noted that since their arrest had been unlawful it still breached Article 5(1) of the Convention. In regards to the other plaintiffs, their three-month long detention was reasonable on paper considering their reluctance to return to their home country which is one of the poorest in the world and plagued by militias. They had done everything possible to obstruct the authorities meaning that it was reasonable for the defendant to seek their detention so as to prevent them from hiding or fleeing. Three months was not a long period of time when considering the exchange of information that needed to be carried out with authorities of an under-developed country which was not exactly a model of efficiency. This however changed when it was soon clear that the Malian authorities did not intend on cooperate and that after one month it was already abundantly clear that the local authorities would not be receiving the plaintiffs’ travel documents. In addition, the witness accounts about the horrid conditions kept in the detention center rendered the plaintiffs’ duration of arrest further unreasonable. The constitutional court however rebutted the lower court’s assertion that the plaintiffs did not have adequate legal remedies, saying that the current proceedings were the best evidence against that claim and the fact that they encountered difficulties for their lawyer to speak to them did not amount to breach in their fundamental rights as contemplated by the Convention. Another Malian arrested with the plaintiffs had successfully sought ordinary remedy and obtained his release without needing to resort to the constitutional court, further confirming that the plaintiffs had adequate legal recourse. The constitutional court also took issue with the previous court’s judgement regarding possible breaches to their rights in the eventuality that they were deported. It said that European case law had found that applicants could not claim to be victim of a deportation order if the measure was not enforceable as was the case for the matter at hand. In addition, there was not sufficient proof to justify the lower court’s claim that the plaintiffs had successfully integrated into Maltese society. Only a few years had passed since their arrival in Malta and the case was different to for example a child who had been raised on the Island. No evidence had been provided to substantiate the claim that they had regularised employment and nonetheless the fact that they were given the right to work did not mean that they were no longer prohibited migrants. The fact that a person preferred to live somewhere as opposed to his home country did not automatically give him the right to do so. The Convention provided ample margin for a country to decide upon its own immigration policy and there could be no doubt that a small country such as Malta had limitations on the number of migrants it could accept, further increasing the authorities’ discretion on the matter. The court ordered appeal expenses to be divided between the parties.",Maltese,

These were deemed to have been intended to damage his reputation and the defendant was ordered to pay him €2,400 in compensation. The case went back eleven years when the appellant had written two articles two months apart in a local daily newspaper called ‘The Malta Independent’. The defendant appealed the lower court judgment as irrelevant, contradictory and making erroneous considerations, failing to take into consideration numerous factors and essential elements and the author’s sole intention was to educate on a topic of public interest as was in her right. In the article, the defendant had discussed the plaintiff’s political party ‘Assocjazzjoni Nazzjonali Repubblikana’, whose political beliefs she equated with fascism. She said they were uninterested in the democratic process and were fanning a frenzy of hatred and fear of the outsider and, by extension, of any other Maltese who did not share their extremist beliefs. In the article “Black shirt and blacker hearts” the defendant said that even though the plaintiff wished to be called “far-right”, his words and actions constituted a real threat of fascism. The court considered that the period when the articles were written had been characterised by a ferocious debate on the issue of migration and had been marred by some instances of violence. The court said that even though the plaintiff tried to frame himself as a moderate thinker, his declared views seemed particularly extreme as he had called for a stop of all migration. It noted how the defendant had based her articles on interviews given by the plaintiff to ‘msnbc.com’, ‘Washington Post’ and ‘The International Herald Tribune’, in which he had said that Maltese citizens did not want a multicultural society and irregular migrants could never be allowed out of detention centers. He had gone on to show his dismay for the presence of black Africans walking the street and said that migrants were destroying Maltese culture. The court said that a distinction must be made between facts and fair comment, while remembering that a statement of fact could be proven, while not the same could be said about value judgement. The court felt that the appellant had expressed her opinion based on the position the plaintiff had taken in the quoted articles in the foreign media. Although the word “fascist” might have been harsh, it was only a critique of the political ideas that the members of the ANR party expressed. A reader of the articles could easily understand that the author was doing value judgement on the plaintiff’s opinions of migration and other members of the party, creating a climate of intolerance towards migrants. Since migration is a topic of public interest, the author had great liberties to express her opinion on the plaintiff’s beliefs. She did not say that the plaintiff was violent but that the party members, with their words and ideas, were contributing to a culture of violence. The author had every right to comment in the way she did, especially when considering that the interviews had been given to foreign news outlets and most certainly gave the whole country a bad name. The court therefore accepted the appeal and ordered the previous sentence erased. Court expenses of both instances borne by the plaintiff.",Maltese,

The defendant had allegedly teamed up with a second, unidentified individual and had attempted to steal from a house in Floriana. The alleged victim had forgiven the defendant and claimed that nothing had been stolen and that no door had been forced open, contrary to what was claimed by the police who upon arriving on site had found damaged apertures and injuries on the victim’s face. Before handing down a judgement the court took the opportunity to delve into far-reaching considerations concerning immigration, solidarity, integration and public order. The court started by saying that this case had great reverberation on news site and social media and it was dismayed by the racist comments often made on migrants and asked itself what had happened to the values of hospitality and love which traditionally formed part of the country’s identity. It quoted numerous prominent people, starting from Pope John Paul II who in his encyclical “Caritas in Veritate” had commented on the topic of migration calling it the “social phenomenon of the era” and saying that every migrant was endowed with fundamental, unalienable rights which needed to be respected by everyone and in every circumstance. The court quoted the Pope during his visit to Malta in 2001, when he had said:
 “Malta is at the centre of the Mediterranean. You therefore have a unique vocation to be builders of bridges between the peoples of the Mediterranean basin, between Africa and Europe. The future of peace in the world depends on strengthening dialogue and understanding between cultures and religions. Continue in your traditions of hospitality, and continue in your national and international commitment on behalf of freedom, justice and peace.”
 The court stressed that Malta was bearing a heavy load which could be lessened by the education system and civil society which could help the Maltese citizens better understand these people who come from different cultures in order to reduce stereotypes which are often times based on ignorance and fear. The court quoted other persons such as the President of Malta Marie Louise Coleiro Preca, the Bishop of Gozo and Pope Francis. The latter had called for a change in attitude towards immigrants and refugees by putting aside instincts of defensiveness, fear, indifference and marginalization which he called “throwaway culture” and a progressive move towards what he called a “culture of encounter”. The court concluded this digression by saying that this did not mean being accepting of any bad attitude these vulnerable people may have. It said that while the immigrants who had a total disregard for local law were in the extreme minority, those few risked putting the many law-abiding individuals in a negative light. At this point, the court advised the authorities to use a strong hand when dealing with these erring individuals and even cited the law which permitted authorities to expel persons given refugee status on the basis of national interest or public order. The court then entered into the merits of the case and said that all the criteria had been met for it to be considered an attempted crime; that is, there was proof of the intention to commit a crime, the commencement of the crime itself and failure to complete due to circumstances outside of the perpetrator’s control. However, the court noted that for a person to be considered a recidivist the previous sentence needed to have been served. In the plaintiff’s case he had been previously handed a suspended sentence, but had failed to pay the fine imposed, and therefore his sentence could not be considered to have been entirely served. The court called on the authorities to carry out the amendments necessary to fix this legal loophole which only served to encourage the violation of legitimate court judgements. The court therefore found the plaintiff guilty of the attempted aggravated theft and sentenced him to eight months imprisonment.",Maltese,

The plaintiffs were the legitimate tenants of two apartments which were used for Muslim prayer as well as their daily residence. They stressed to the Court that the Muslim community of Malta gathered there to pray and practice a major monotheistic belief, recognised by the Catholic Church. The plaintiffs noted how the Authority had not taken any action on the premises being used as place of prayer but had later decided that its use was illegal and issued a Stop and Enforcement Notice. The plaintiffs argued that this constituted religious discrimination in contravention of the European Convention on Human Rights because Catholic prayer places were not treated in a similar manner. The plaintiffs cited various Catholic local groups which met in private locations and hotels and were not subject to the same procedures, while stressing that mass was occasionally held at the premises of The Chamber of Advocates, the Appeals Court and even the defendant Authority’s premises. In addition, no Church in Malta required any permit similar to what is being asked of the plaintiffs and there was no risk to the public order or the country’s security. The defendants were also accused of breaching Article 8(1) of the Convention in regards to two of the plaintiffs because they had been prohibited from entering their residence and were having criminal actions taken against them. The plaintiffs therefore asked the court to erase every order issued by the Authority as well as the criminal procedures initiated by the defendant Commissioner. The defendants rebutted that the plaintiffs were abusing from the justice system by seeking Constitutional recourse when there were ordinary procedures which they yet had to be utilized to seek redress. The plaintiffs had the right to appeal the enforcement order in front of the Environment and Planning Review Tribunal because, contrary to what they stated, a permit was required in order to utilize a place as a place of worship while the locations in question were licenced solely for private residences. The Authority was bound to intervene once these residences were instead used for public gatherings, as the plaintiffs had failed to apply for the necessary permits. They said that the plaintiffs’ claims were unfounded because the Commissioner had performed his duty by initiating criminal proceedings and the Authority had not violated any of the plaintiffs’ fundamental rights for religious freedom and private life. The court started by saying that the Authority’s actions were seemingly based on legislation and internal policy and not on religious bias as the plaintiffs had claimed, while also failing to provide any evidence. The same photos presented by the plaintiffs gave further weight to the defendants’ actions because they showed a neglected apartment, free from any furniture and with shelving intended for the placement of shoes, confirming that the location was not being used for residential purposes. The change of use of a residence required a change in permits for which the plaintiffs had failed to apply. A special permit was required for every new place used for worship or religious teachings, irrespective of the professed religion. The court reprimanded the plaintiffs for what it described as a provocative list of locations in which Catholic functions were permitted, saying that they had attempted to mislead the court with situations that were very dissimilar to the case in hand. The Catholic celebrations the plaintiffs brought as examples were occasional functions as opposed to the plaintiff’s own admission that their apartments were used on a daily basis for evening prayers by groups larger than twenty individuals. The court said that the religious bias had not been proved and that no one is above the law, not even for religious purposes. In addition, the criminal procedures initiated by the defendant Commissioner were warranted as the plaintiffs had failed to abide by legitimate enforcement orders. The plaintiffs had proved themselves intransigent. The court therefore rejected all of the plaintiffs’ claims and ordered them to bear court expenses.",Maltese,

The defendant had arrived in Malta from Libya in the company of the accomplice and during a body search, the latter was found to be in possession of two packages containing cannabis, one in his pocket and another in his sandals. The drugs were wrapped in black tape, similar to the one found in the defendant’s possession. Forensic experts were appointed to test whether the tape which wrapped the drugs matched the tape found in the defendant’s possession but the results were inconclusive and no DNA or fingerprints were found. The co-accused had initially blamed the defendant, writing in a sworn declaration that the packages had been handed to him by the defendant and that he had thought that they were in actual fact money. He later retracted his statement and in court had admitted to lying to the prosecution. This was confirmed by two fellow inmates, one of whom acted as an unofficial Imam who led the prison’s Muslim prayers, who said that the defendant’s alleged accomplice had shown regret for his actions. Apart from the sworn statement, the prosecution’s strongest evidence derived from the witness account of a police inspector who had been placed in the room with the two accused and unbeknownst to them, was fluent in the Arabic language. She said that she heard the accomplice tell the accused that he should shoulder responsibility and admit that the drugs were indeed his. To this, the defendant allegedly said that he need not worry and that he was going to get them a very competent lawyer. According to the witness, the co-accused gave a sigh of relief when he discovered that the police inspector, who later served as translator for his sworn statement, knew Arabic and had overheard their conversation. The defence poked holes in the witness’ account, saying that her version of events did not match with the official timeline because the sigh of relief had happened when he had already given his sworn statement for which the witness had served as translator and therefore it should not have come as a surprise that she knew Arabic. In addition, if she had indeed entered the interrogation room and remained quiet, it was not clear how communication between the plaintiff and the defendants occurred since the co-accused knew neither English nor Maltese. The defendant rejected all accusations saying that he did not know the alleged accomplice and had met him for the first time when they had applied for a visa to enter Malta. He explained that the tape found on him was used while drawing Henna tattoos and that in actual fact he was a singer as evidenced by the violin in his possession. He claimed he entered Malta in order to record a music album. The court accepted the defence’s objections regarding the police inspector’s witness account and said that it had managed to instil doubt in the court’s mind regarding the exact sequence of events. The prosecution’s most important evidence remained the co-accused’s sworn statement but which had been weakened by his own retraction in court and the witness accounts of his fellow inmates. The co-accused clearly would have had little to benefit by retracting a statement which placed the blame on the defendant and therefore one might be induced to believe his change of heart. In addition, the latter had been found to be under the influence of cannabis and the photos shown in court gave little weight to his initial statement that he thought the packets contained money, as they did not match the size, shape and weight one would reasonably expect from a wad of cash. The court said that there was little evidence to incriminate the defendant except for having similar black tape in his possession and to which he had provided a plausible justification, and the accomplice’s sworn statement which was found to be unreliable. The court felt that there were sufficient reasons to create doubt in favour of the defendant and therefore liberated him from all charges brought against him.",Maltese,

The couple had a child out of wedlock and during proceedings, in order to obtain sole custody of the child, the plaintiff had requested the court to grant permission for a priest they had confided in during their attempts to save their relationship to give witness. She stated that the nature of the revelations during their meeting would have repercussions in the custody proceedings underway and that the priest was a competent witness since no information had been given during a confession. The defendant had objected to the plaintiff’s request for sole custody saying that he should be allowed to participate in decisions in the best interest of the minor son, who should be brought up with respect to both his Maltese and German heritage, while learning the languages of both countries. He also objected that the priest gives witness noting that the matter concerned the guarantee of confidentiality provided by a Roman Catholic priest to two people consulting him and seeking his guidance regarding personal matters. The lower court had rejected the plaintiff’s request saying that all information obtained by the priest had been given on the basis of trust. Confidentiality between the parties was at core of the relationship and thus in absence of grave information which made it legally incumbent on the witness to divulge such information, the court felt that unless permitted by the defendant, it would be improper for it to authorise the priest to give evidence in the proceedings. The relationship with a priest is more profound than that with a marriage counsellor or social worker who could be easily ordered by the court to testify. The plaintiff appealed the decision saying that no information divulged to the witness had been obtained under the seal of confession and that it is in the best interests of the child for such information. The plaintiff cited canon law 1550(2)(ii) which prohibited priests from testifying only on matters pertaining to what they came to know in confession. She noted that case law had determined that a clergyman was precluded from providing witness only if he declared that he was bound by secrecy. Apart from that, there was nothing that prohibited a clergyman from giving witness. On the other hand, the defendant cited Article 588(1) of Chapter 12 of the Laws of Malta which said that no clergyman without the consent of the person making the confession may be questioned on such circumstances which came to his knowledge under the seal of confession or loco confessionis. He also cited Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua, American Law, Article 257 of the Criminal Code and Article 12 of the Professional Secrecy Act. The criminal code provided that disclosure of a professional secret was a criminal offence punishable on conviction with a fine and/or imprisonment and this included any persons who become depositary of any secret confided in them by reason of their calling. The Secrecy Act on the other hand included persons who become the depositary of any secret confided in him by reason of his calling. The Court of Appeal noted that both parties agreed that anything divulged to the priest had not been done under the seal of confession, but loco confessionis (strict confidence) applied. There was no evidence that what the defendant told the priest was said during a confession and not all communications to a clergyman of a confidential nature qualified as a confession. The wording of the law indicated that a confession was made in connection with or in discharge of a religious duty or calling and there was no indication that during the meetings the defendant had sought penitential acknowledgement and forgiveness or religious or spiritual guidance. The court however noted how the Professional Secrecy Act, while not specifically including clergymen, was written in a certain way as to give reason to understand that the said list was not exhaustive. The court said that the Secrecy Act also stipulated that in the absence of any specific provision in relation to any particular calling the existing rules of law applied for witness release, thus giving ample discretion to the courts. Evidence showed that the priest was not a friend or acquaintance of the parties and the defendant had spoken to him purely as an attempt to seek outside help in overcoming their relationship problems. The defendant was thus justified to expect that whatever came to the priest’s knowledge would be treated with confidence. The defendant would have acted differently had he known that if matters were not resolved amicably. It was therefore within the lower court’s discretion to decide whether the priest should be allowed to give witness regarding the confidential exchanges he had with the parties. The Court of Appeal also rejected the appellant’s claim that the information ought to be disclosed even if it was considered confidential because it affected the best interests of the child. It said that there was no proof of this. The fact that proceedings referred to the custody of a minor it did not mean that any information was relevant. The appeal was therefore rejected with court expenses borne by the appellant.",English,

The contract signed by the parties obliged the defendant to negotiate and conclude contracts in Libya related to the registration of a company, in view of future participation in public tenders relating to the construction of roads and bridges in the North African country. The contract bound the defendant to carry out the registration process in accordance to Libyan law within nine weeks from the date of the agreement. The plaintiff company had paid him €14,000 for the cost of registration and all other expenses incurred by the defendant while in Libya. The plaintiff explained that they had known the defendant for four years and he had promised to successfully register their company in Libya within three weeks. They claimed that the defendant had equally promised to provide them with a preferential route to business in Libya by introducing them to Mutassim Gaddafi, son of Libyan ruler Muammar Gaddafi, who controlled the Libyan National Holding Company, thus paving the way for the plaintiffs to obtain governmental contracts. Indeed, an initial contract had been signed by the parties, an agreement which had then fallen through because the plaintiffs were unable to register the company in Libya which was a prerequisite in order to carry out works in the North African country. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant had failed to honour the terms of contract solely due to his intransigence, while failing to inform it of any developments in the registration process. The company noted that when the stipulated time elapsed, they had graciously extended the period by twenty-seven days and at that stage was even ready to accept the deduction of all expenses and one thousand Libyan dinar spent for the registration process had he still failed to fulfil his obligations after the extension period. However, when even this time period elapsed, the plaintiff company requested the plaintiff to sever all ties, refund them the €14,000 in its totality and consider all work carried out after the original nine-week period as not carried out in representation of the company. The plaintiff therefore requested the court to order the return of all the money, including damages and interest accrued from the end of the original contract. The defendant objected saying that the plaintiff’s claims were baseless both in fact and law. Not only had they extended the time period but from the €14,000 grant one needed to deduct all personal expenses, the one thousand Libyan Dinar as well as the sum of €9,000 paid to Libyan authorities in connection to the procedure of registration of the company. The defendant contended that even if interest were to be imposed it had to commence from two days following the issuance of the legal letter sent to him by the plaintiff and not on the day the original contract terms had ended. In addition, the time frame had not been realistic because no company could be registered in Libya within nine weeks. The process had also been delayed due to the plaintiff’s delayed response at providing him with the copious and important documentation which required translation into Arabic. In addition, he encountered problems to acquire a visa to enter Libya. An architect involved in the process took the stand and confirmed that the process of registering a company in Libya was very difficult, requiring a multitude of factors; most importantly personal relations with the Gaddafi family who had control over all governmental agencies. The architect confirmed that the plaintiff had previously attempted and failed to open a company in Libya and therefore had sought the services of the defendant. The defendant’s uncle also gave witness by reiterating the fact that at the time, business dealing in Libya were not carried out in a normal way but everything moved very slowly, with situations which changed from one day to another. Company registration in Libya required a lot of time and money and in this case the process had been further delayed by Ramadan, national feasts and visa problems. The court started by saying that it first had to determine if the defendant had failed to honour the obligations stipulated by the contract. It noted how the witnesses had confirmed that the registration of a company in Libya was not always automatic as there was substantial political interference and the requirements could change without notice. The plaintiff had previously attempted and failed to open a company in Libya and therefore was well aware that there were no guarantees regarding its success. In this regard, the court noted that the words used in the contract between the parties did not bind the defendant to register a company in Libya but instead it obliged him to complete the registration process. Once the registration process was completed there was no guarantee that the company would in actual fact be registered and, even if the application were to be accepted, the plaintiff company was still legally bound to open a bank account in Libya in order to finalize the registration process in accordance to Libyan Law. The court said that the plaintiff had failed to indicate at which point of the registration process had the defendant arrived and it was their obligation to prove that he failed to carry out his contractual obligations. There was no proof that there had been a lack of diligence on part of the defendant, on the contrary, he seemed to have made his utmost but unforeseen events stopped him from finalizing the registration. He had presented the Libyan authorities with the necessary documentation and to do so he had submitted them to Libyan Chamber of Commerce in Malta who were responsible for carrying out the necessary translations, while ensuring that they were authenticated by the Libyan Embassy in Malta. The authorities in Malta had confirmed that the defendant would often call and exert pressure on them in order to finish the translations as soon as possible. The court also agreed with the defendant that in some instances the delay was attributable to the plaintiff’s tardiness at providing him with the necessary documentation. In addition, there were other unforeseen circumstances such as when his request for a Libyan visa had been rejected even though he had visited the country on numerous occasions and never encountered any issues. The court concluded that the defendant could not be held responsible for not honouring his contractual obligations as it was clear that the reasons were not attributable to any action on his part. The court therefore rejected the plaintiff’s requests and ordered them to bear all court expenses.",Maltese,

The couple had married some fifteen years prior and shared two minor children. The plaintiff was a Maltese national of foreign heritage while the defendant was the son of the Imam at Malta’s only mosque. She said that she had done everything to keep the family together and raise the children well, even taking University courses so as to increase her cultural knowledge and help her understand better her husband’s ideas. Problems started emerging three weeks after marrying when the plaintiff discovered that the defendant had many outstanding debts due to business ventures antecedent to their marriage. It was for this reason that she started working and the proceeds went entirely to the defendant, including the children allowance granted by social services. The defendant had complete control over their finances and would provide her with no financial support, leading her to seek help from her own father. The plaintiff said that the couple’s problems increased after the birth of their first child when the defendant would rarely be present at home and it occasionally happened that the police came knocking at their door and she would be unable to tell them his whereabouts. The defendant left the household about ten years after and went to live with family members. In accordance to Islamic tradition, the defendant’s father had contacted the plaintiff’s own father in order to stipulate in writing the amount of maintenance which was due to his wife. The plaintiff said that he had not followed through with the agreement and provided no financial support to her and only paid maintenance directly to the children. The financial situation however did not ameliorate and this started having repercussions on the home loan, with the plaintiff and her children risking eviction. The plaintiff found out that the defendant had travelled to Syria and there, according to local customs, had remarried and subsequently brought his new wife to Malta on a work permit. While she had no proof of his second marriage, she was certain that as the son of Malta’s Imam he would not have been allowed to cohabit with a woman outside of marriage. She had been told by her children that the couple had a child together and was expecting a second. The defendant agreed with the request for divorce and the court acceded to the couple’s request with court expenses to be divided between the parties.",Maltese,

The plaintiff, a Maltese national, had married a Russian national in her home country but when he sought to register the marriage in Malta, the defendant asked him to obtain a certificate from the Department of Citizenship and Expatriate Affairs confirming his Maltese nationality. The plaintiff had alleged in front of the lower court that the defendant was not abiding by his duty of registering the marriage celebrated abroad, simply because he was not native of Malta and said that the defendant would not have had a similar attitude if his surname had been a typical Maltese family name. Although born in Syria, the plaintiff had no link to his native country and had no right to a Syrian passport. Everywhere he went, explained the plaintiff, he was immediately accepted as a Maltese citizen and it was only the Office of the defendant which objected. He said that the defendant had also failed to obey a legitimate order issued by the Court of Revision of Notarial Acts which had directed the Registry to accept the plaintiff’s marriage. This meant that the defendant was in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights which protected against discriminatory behaviour and which stipulated that everyone had a right to family life and to obtain recourse from the relevant tribunals. The defendant had rejected the claims saying that the plaintiff’s request for registration of the marriage had not been rejected but was currently on hold, pending the necessary documentation. The defendant placed the blame entirely on the plaintiff saying that every Maltese citizen was required to obtain a certificate which confirmed their Maltese citizenship. While in most cases the passport would suffice, the plaintiff’s cases required further confirmation because his citizenship had been obtained by naturalisation through marriage, which had later been declared null by the courts for being a marriage of convenience. In addition, the Russian marriage certificate presented by the plaintiff had been issued by the Civil Registry Administration in Moscow and lacked the necessary stamps which were only issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Moscow. The defendant argued that even while the plaintiff alleged discrimination, he was in actual fact asking the court to discriminate in his favour by not adhering to procedures required for everybody else. In addition, the judgement by the Court of Revision of Notarial Acts had been overturned in appeal and the same court had said that the defendant was bound by his duty to register the marriage only after the plaintiff had presented the necessary documentation. The lower court had found that no breaches in the plaintiff’s fundamental rights saying that it was within the defendant’s rights to request the necessary documentation, especially in light of the plaintiff’s particular circumstances, as it might happen that one might have citizenship revoked but still be in possession of his passport. While the defendant’s request meant further bureaucratic delays, this inconvenience did not amount to a violation of the plaintiff’s rights and his request to have his marriage registered had not yet been refused. The lower court had expressed it perplexity at the plaintiff’s insistence not to present the requested authenticated documents and had rejected the plaintiff claims with court expenses borne by the latter. The plaintiff appealed the sentence in front of the Constitutional Court. In the meantime, the defendant had accepted to register the marriage but the plaintiff continued with proceedings claiming that the delays had nonetheless breached his rights. The court started off by saying that the proceedings seemed nothing but unnecessary feuding by the plaintiff and his legal advisor combined with departmental lethargy on the part of the defendant. It stated that no right for an alien to enter or to reside in a particular country was as such guaranteed by the Convention and the defendant had every right to ensure that all procedural requirements were followed. The court, however, did note that the defendant had delayed registering the marriage even after receiving confirmation from the Department of Citizenship and Expatriate Affairs that the plaintiff was indeed in possession of Maltese citizenship. The Department had given evidence during the previous court proceedings but numerous months passed before they proceeded with the registration, further adding to the plaintiff’s frustration. The court said that this interdepartmental lethargy verged on maladministration would need to be reflected in the costs. The court therefore rejected the plaintiff’s appeal and confirmed the lower court’s sentence except for the allocation of court expenses, which were to be divided between the parties.",Maltese,

The plaintiff, a Libyan national, had arrived in Malta on a 3-day visa in order to visit his father and three of his brothers who resided on the Island. The permit had been later extended by a few weeks but after that the plaintiff had failed to extend it further. In the meantime, the plaintiff had started a relationship with a Maltese woman with whom he had a child, with another on the way. Some two years after first arriving in Malta, the defendant Officer had issued a Removal Order by which he intended to repatriate the plaintiff who was considered a Prohibited migrant. The request for removal of the plaintiff had been accepted by the Immigration Appeals Board and this left the plaintiff with no other option but to seek recourse in the Constitutional court. The plaintiff claimed the defendants’ actions were in breach of Articles 32 and 45 of the Constitution of Malta and Articles 1, 8, 13 and 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights which protected a person’s right for family life and effective domestic remedy free from discrimination. The plaintiff therefore asked the court to declare the defendants’ actions illegal, while awarding him compensation. The court said that the fact that a person had a family life did not exempt him from following his legal obligations in regards to immigration law which gave the State many powers in the name of national security, public safety and economic well-being of the country. Had the plaintiff adhered to such obligations and sought to extend his residence permit, it would have probably been granted upon proving his family life in Malta. The decision to grant his stay rested entirely on the shoulders of the relevant authorities and not the migrant. The decision to remove the plaintiff was legitimate and taken in order to follow the Law of Malta which had been broken by the plaintiff when he had decided not to extend his visa. Having said that, the court said that while the defendants had acted legitimately and the plaintiff’s fundamental rights had not been breached, the case in question seemed genuine and advised the authorities to reconsider its decision to expel the plaintiff. This, the court emphasised, was a recommendation and held no legal obligation.",Maltese,

The plaintiff had celebrated nuptials with a Thai national in the Thai Consulate of Dubai and some years later they had obtained a divorce in Muan Chiang Mai, Thailand. He explained that Thai law contemplated two methods for obtaining a divorce, either through the courts or else by a purely administrative method which necessitated the presence of both parties and two other witnesses. The plaintiff made use of the latter method without requiring the intervention of the juridical organ and the divorce was considered legitimate according to Thai legislation and custom. However, the plaintiff took to the Maltese courts when the defendant refused to register the divorce in the Maltese Registry on the basis that it did not satisfy Maltese divorce law requirements. The defendant said that the Law of Malta clearly stipulated that for a divorce to be recognized in Malta it must be obtained from the competent courts of the country of residence or origin of either party. Therefore, the method used by the couple might have legal validity in Thailand but did not meet the requirements stipulated by Maltese law. The court noted that the plaintiff had failed to explain whether he had verified beforehand with the Maltese authorities to confirm if the divorce method he eventually utilized was accepted on the Islands, especially since he had already filed the marriage with the Public Registry. The court agreed with the defendant that the law was clear in this regard and did not allow for divorce decrees which did not originate from the relevant courts. If the legislator had wanted to make exceptions to this rule, it would have acted accordingly and the court was bound not to create exceptions that are not found in law. It must be assumed that the words used in legislation reflect the intentions of the legislator, as the Roman Law maxim goes Ubi lex voluti dixit, ubi noluit tacuit (when the law wills, it speaks, when it does not will, it is silent).

The plaintiff explained that the couple had met during a common friend’s party and married about a year later. He said that during that initial period the defendant, a Russian national, often discussed her residence permit and told him that her visa was soon to expire. Convinced by the defendant’s professed love for the plaintiff and her seemingly respectful and loving nature, the plaintiff eventually gave in to the defendant’s insistence to marry. The plaintiff says problems started to emerge about six months into the marriage when she started battling alcoholism and spent a large portion of the day inebriated. He had sought help from a non-governmental and although initially she warmed to the idea of going to therapy, she eventually refused any help. The defendant started disappearing for long periods of time and the plaintiff said that numerous police reports were filed to report the matter. She would eventually return home without divulging anything about her whereabouts. She went out of her way to ensure that the plaintiff would not meet her family and whenever they were in Malta the defendant would keep them far from her husband. In view of these difficulties, the plaintiff filed for a personal separation some three years after marrying and he came to believe that the defendant had married him in order to obtain Maltese citizenship. After the separation proceedings, the defendant returned to her home country of Russia and the plaintiff said that he lost all contact from his estranged wife. The court started out by criticising the legal procurator for not adequately representing the interests of the defendant who had not been reached to give her versions of events. It even had a word for the plaintiff for failing to provide any information on the defendant in order for her to be reached. This meant, the court said, that the sentence would have to be decided based entirely on the evidence provided by the plaintiff, which the court agued did not amount to much. Marriage was an important institution and the court was obliged to evaluate with great scrutiny all the evidence brought forward, which evidence must be certain, convincing and leaving no doubt that the annulment in question was not being requested carelessly. The court said that the plaintiff had alleged many shortcomings by the defendant but which were not backed by objective proof. There was no proof that the defendant had pressured the plaintiff into marriage and he had also failed to provide any evidence of her visa situation from the relevant authority or even the Russian Embassy. Also, the accusation that there had been a case of mistaken identity was not even discussed and the court felt sure that after a relationship of more than four years everyone knew perfectly well the identity of the contracting party. The plaintiff had also tried to base his case on the defendant’s supposed alcoholism, but even though he had failed to prove this in any way, the plaintiff admitted that the drinking problem had started after celebrating nuptials, without hinting in any way that there had been deceit involved. In addition, there was no evidence that any of the parties lacked the discretion necessary or excluded any of the essential elements of marriage. The court therefore rejected the plaintiff’s request and ordered him to bear all expenses.",Maltese,

The plaintiff explained that she came from a difficult family circumstances in which her brother suffered from a serious case of autism meaning that her parents dedicated all their time, strength and attention to care for his needs. She could not remember a single happy episode of her younger years at home as she grew up lonely due to the lack of affection and love. The plaintiff described how the atmosphere at the household was never relaxed, with the family members who had to lock all doors in the house and walk around with the keys in their pockets because her brother had a constant urge to break things. She would often cry in need of someone to hug or play with and the Christmas period offered little respite as her brother would not even allow the family to decorate the house. She felt that leaving the family residence was her only avenue out of a situation which caused her great sadness and restriction. It was in this backdrop that she met the defendant and even though she did not feel comfortable in a committed relationship after such a long period of solitude, she made her best for the relationship to work. A short period after her brother was admitted to a care facility because her parents could no longer manage his condition, the plaintiff left in her own right in order to cohabit with her new partner. Initially with the defendant she felt distracted from everything she had experienced in the previous years but after a couple of months things started slipping. She found the defendant very controlling and the slightest noise bothered him causing her to seek his permission to use any appliance that made the least of noise. This caused her great anxiety leading her be afraid to sneeze or cough in fear of causing him discomfort. More problems started emerging between the couple but the plaintiff refused to return to her parent’s home and did not have the financial means to buy a place for herself, meaning that she made up her mind to make things work between them. She progressively lost confidence in herself and the couple’s sexual relationship deteriorated. She blamed the location where they lived or her job on her feelings of dissatisfaction which were accompanied by a chronic lack of ability to enjoy life, apathy and even suicidal thoughts. The couple married after two years of cohabitation in the hope that it would give her new meaning and that her personal situation would improve, especially after relocating to France for a few months and changing job. On more than one occasion prior to the marriage she had wished to cancel everything and escape but the plaintiff said that she lacked the courage to leave everything and start from scratch. However, after the marriage things did not improve and she felt very anxious about the decisions she had taken fearing that she had committed the biggest mistake of her life by marrying the defendant. Her mental health deteriorated so much that she visited a psychiatrist who diagnosed her with untreated depression and medication soon ameliorated her condition. After changing jobs, house, country and treating her depression the plaintiff had no more excuses to justify to herself why she was so miserable and after a period of family counselling she came to the realisation that she did not love the defendant and considered him little more than a friend or roommate. She realised that she had married simply because she was too weak due to the depression and did not have the strength and courage to take the decisions needed. She came from a culture in which a decision to end a marriage was not taken lightly and for these reasons it was not easy for her to leave the defendant. But after years of suffering, she realised that her health and happiness were to be given greater priority than tradition and other people’s opinion. The plaintiff said that after asking the defendant for a separation she felt as though she had been liberated from a prison life sentence and free from every weight on her mind and heart. The court started off by saying that lack of reflection on the matrimonial life or on its essential rights or duties did not necessarily amount to a serious defect of discretion which merited the annulment of marriage. However, if at the moment of consent a party was deprived of the capacity to make free choice and enter consciously and liberally to a communion life of love, there might be lack of discretion of judgement as required by law. The court said that the plaintiff had been raised in an environment barren from that family life and affection that in adulthood is known to help form emotional maturity and relationship stability. Even though cohabitation with the defendant had started off bad from the start, the plaintiff remained stagnated in that situation because she felt that it was nonetheless better than life at home. It was this that led her to lack the discretion of judgment necessary to understand what marriage really meant. She had never really experienced a functional matrimonial life and saw in the defendant an escape from an oppressive environment. In addition, her depression which was diagnosed some five months after marrying, but which symptoms had been present from long before, meant that when she gave her consent, she did not possess the mental and emotional health to respond because she was a slave to her depression. This meant that her mental state precluded her from giving valid consent for marriage. The court therefore acceded to plaintiff’s request and declared marriage null with court expenses left untaxed due to the sensitivity of the case.

The plaintiffs requested the changes to be carried out in the father’s birth certificate and subsequently in the couple’s marriage certificate, their two children’s birth certificate and all other civil documentation. The father explained that he had been named by his parents as “George” in a town whose patron saint was St. George, meaning that at the time almost every family named at least one son -sometimes even a daughter- after the village saint. To make things worse, even the surname was far from rare, with the plaintiff recounting that his uncle and cousin who lived next door had the exact same name and surname as did two other students in his class in primary school. In the 60s his primary teachers immediately recognized the problems he would encounter when it came to receiving grades and school certificates and in order to differentiate between the students, they decided to include his mother’s surname in the school register meaning that his surname was double-barrelled. From that day onwards he came to be known by this new surname in legal, academic, professional and personal settings. The plaintiff noted how his identity cards, passports and election documents all carried the double surname and so did all the certificates he obtained all the way to the obtainment of his doctorate. The same could be said for his wife who since marriage had always been known by this surname, and for their two children. The plaintiff explained that after graduating in the early 70s he starting taking part in numerous public and cultural activities in Malta with the presentation of educational programmes on the Maltese language and linguistics, literature, folklore and Maltese anthropology, on all forms of media including newspaper articles, theses, books, conferences and discussion and presentations of cultural nights in various locations around Malta and Gozo dealing with both Maltese oral narratives and Maltese literature. The plaintiff said that academics of Maltese language and culture and the general public, knew him and referred to him by this full name. In addition, there was another less well-known Maltese author who had his name and first surname and thus after more than thirty years in the cultural sphere with the double-barrelled surname, the plaintiff felt that there remained no reason for him to retain his old surname considering even his status as a public figure. His professional career included accomplishments even far from the Maltese shores, with the plaintiff who had contributed greatly as a scientific consultant with international journals and was considered an authoritative figure on the international stage on the Maltese narrative. His studies on the subject were renown with numerous foreign academics in England, US, France, Italy and Germany. The plaintiff concluded by saying that his parents were simple people who had always lived within the confines of the Maltese village and never could they have envisaged the need for future corrections. They could never understand the possible social and cultural difficulties he would encounter, meaning that it was up to him to take the necessary initiatives. The defendant objected to the changes saying that the Civil Code gave the plaintiff the right to show both his parents’ surnames but it did not give him the right to change his birth certificate which was a document that registered a historical event. On the other hand, the defendant said that if the plaintiff successfully proved that he had been using the double surname for a sufficiently long period, then the defendant would not object for their request for the marriage certificate to be changed as well as the children’s birth certificates. The court noted that there could not be any doubt that the second surname was indeed the plaintiff’s mother’s surname, nor that he had been using the proposed surname since childhood, as confirmed by the voluminous documentation presented.

The couple had met online, with the defendant who had travelled to Cairo to meet him and after a month and a half they relocated to Jordan where the couple got married. At the time she was married to another person so when she fell pregnant the paternity had to be determined by the courts months later when they were in Malta. The plaintiff said that the relationship breakdown was imputable to the defendant’s infidelity who had left the family residence six months prior and, while before he had an active role in their son’s life, now the defendant was making it hard for him to do so as she was denying him any form of access and at that point had not seen the child for a number of months. He claimed that he had a very good relationship with his son and that it was in the child’s best interests for him to maintain a good relationship with his father. There were no reasons to merit supervised access as he ought to have a primary role in his raising. He noted that he only had a residence permit on the Island and, even though he was not allowed to work, he still wished to provide a regular maintenance towards the child’s needs. The defendant rebutted the plaintiff claiming that he was entirely absent from the child’s life and had only recognized him as a means of not being deported from Malta. She accused him of rendering life in their family residence unbearable, forcing her to move back with her parents. She noted that the plaintiff never provided any financial contribution and even though he continued to live in what was their prior shared residence, it was she who always paid the rent, something she continued doing to the present day because the child’s father refused to vacate the premises. She said that it was only when he registered himself as the child’s father did she discover that he was from Kuwait as he had also told her that he was Jordanian. She expressed her fears of the plaintiff absconding from Malta with the child in light of his third country nationality and lack of freedom of movement or labour in Malta. His insincerity was further proven by the fact that he worked irregularly on a boat, while in his Muslim culture there was the belief that men had total control over their children, meaning that the risk of him leaving the Island for good with their offspring was well-motivated. The defendant further claimed that the plaintiff had on multiple occasions voiced these threats of absconding with the child and even though he claimed to want access rights, he was already granted supervised visiting hours by the court but failed to make use of them. She also accused the defendant of being a very violent person with various police reports made against him for beatings against both her and their child. She presented the court with online correspondence with the plaintiff’s partner who professed herself worried about the relationship between the father and son. On one occasion he had threatened to beat the child, while another time he confessed his intent on leaving the country, taking the child with him. The social services agency responsible for overseeing the plaintiff’s visitation hours took to the stand to confirm that access between the father and son was monitored but lately had started providing him more freedom. They described the father’s relationship with his son as positive even though they had warned him on numerous occasions not to ask the minor questions regarding his mother and her partner. He had even confronted the child when the Child’s Advocate wrote that the child had confessed to being afraid of his father, with the minor who later admitted to having been forced to say so by his mother. The court started by stating its dismay for the way the parties were using the child to get to each other without realising the damage they were causing. The court noted that there was conflicting evidence about the plaintiff’s relationship with his son but his partner’s chat history with the defendant seemed to prove her claims that the plaintiff was insincere and therefore not reliable. The Child’ Advocate had noted that while the mother had clearly tried to influence the child against his father, the minor stated that while he enjoyed his time with his father, he could not forget the times when in the past he had raised his hands on both him and his mother. This was further problematic considering that the risk of absconding was still real, particularly due to his employment which was not stable or clearly defined. The court therefore rejected the plaintiff’s appeal for shared care and custody, saying that it was in the best interests of the child for this to remain vested exclusively with the defendant mother. The court confirmed twice-weekly monitored access and reprimanded the social services for allowing access without them being present, in blatant breach of previous court orders. It ordered the child’s passport to be kept by the authorities during these access periods. Finally, the court granted the defendant a €200 monthly maintenance, while ordering the plaintiff to bear all court expenses.",Maltese,

The couple had married twelve years prior after a courtship of six months and from this marriage they had a son who by the time of proceedings was nine years of age. The plaintiff said that on hindsight she believed that her husband, a Syrian national, had married her in order to obtain citizenship rights at a time when he did not even have a valid work permit. The problems emerged soon after marriage, primarily due to their great culture differences. While the defendant tried to instil in her the mentality that the man was the head of the family and she had to obey him in everything, he on the other hand wished to continue living the life of a bachelor and would spend his days out with friends. In fact, the defendant was not at all happy when he discovered that the plaintiff was pregnant, so much so that two months later he abandoned the conjugal home, forcing his wife to seek financial support from her parents, both for her and their son. The court noted that it was clear that even though the defendant took part in the marriage ceremony with the plaintiff, internally he had actively excluded essential obligations of marriage such as exclusive, irrevocable and permanent union directed towards a life of communion, procreation and nurture of children. The court reminded that the capacity to assume these obligations needed to exist in both parties. This commitment towards the future translates in essential obligations for married life, including fidelity, trust, the permanence of marriage and above all the reciprocal well-being between the couple. Obligations, in absence of which, intimate union in all aspects between the spouses is not possible. The court concluded that in the case at hand everything indicated that when the defendant gave his consent, his only goal was to acquire Maltese citizenship through marriage while living the single life with a wife who attended to all of his needs. The court therefore acceded to the plaintiff’s request and declared the marriage null, with court expenses borne by the defendant who did not take part in proceedings.",Maltese,

The couple had met eleven years prior when the defendant had been in the mother’s home state. The mother in turn visited the defendant in Malta the following year and she fell pregnant. The child was born in the US and this motivated the defendant father to try and secure residency in the US to keep the family united but financial difficulties inhibited him from obtaining long term residency rights. The couple decided to marry a few months after the birth of their son. The marriage however lasted less than two years with the separation proceedings stipulating that both were to have care and custody rights over the child but whose habitual residence was to be the US. The father had the right to take the minor to Malta during the summer recess for a period not less than two months but not exceeding three. However, a short time after this agreement had been reached their son was diagnosed with autism and the mother refused to send the child to Malta on the grounds that he was too weak for the long voyage. The defendant had taken the issue to the Americans courts which judged that there was no reason for the access agreement not to be observed. Indeed, the following two summers the minor visited his father but towards the end of the year the defendant asked the mother for him to make use of his access period during the Christmas period, as opposed to the following summer. The mother acceded but the defendant did not hold his part of the agreement and retained the child. The plaintiff was tasked by the American authorities to commence legal proceedings against the defendant and aid in the return of the child on the basis that the defendant contravened the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction and Chapter 410 of the Laws of Malta. The plaintiff pointed out that the parents who share parental responsibilities must provide their consent for the minor to change habitual residence. Shared parental authority meant that both parents should exercise their responsibilities without breaching the other parent’s rights. The minor had been removed from his habitual residence in the US, with the defendant who had acted without the consent of a mother. The defendant rejected these claims, saying that a Maltese court had previously awarded his exclusive care and custody with access rights to the mother. In addition, there existed serious reasons for the court to consider it in the best interest of the child for him to remain in Malta because otherwise it would risk exposing him to psychological damage and an intolerable situation as understood by the Convention. The defendant explained that the mother had unilaterally removed the children from school in order to home school him with the excuse that their son was autistic. The defendant had immediately opposed this decision and his preoccupations were confirmed when the child came to Malta over the Christmas period and the father noted substantial regressions in his academic, physical, social and psychological development. The defendant had sought professional advice on the child’s condition which determined that he had learning difficulties consistent with combined-type Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) but not with autism. Regardless, the defendant claimed that it was within a school context that their son would benefit the most and in Malta he had been enlisted in a school which provided him with a Learning Support Assistant (LSA), allowing the child to register considerable progress. He said that it was not in the child’s best interests to return to the US especially because the mother was using the child’s schooling as a pretext to limit his father’s access since the child was allowed to communicate with his father via Skype during recreation period. The child’s schooling occurred mostly through YouTube videos in a household in which his mother had to take care of two other children which meant that he was not receiving the attention he necessitated. In addition, the defendant said that the child had expressed his wish to remain in Malta, a request that should be respected considering his age and level of maturity. The court started off by saying that it was not this court’s role to determine which parent was most suited to be primary career of the child but its sole duty was to understand if there had been wrongful retention of the child and, if in the affirmative, determine if any exceptions for the child’s return existed. There was no doubt in the court’s eyes that the child’s habitual residence was in the US and that his father had wrongfully retained him in Malta. The defendant’s claim that he had been granted care and custody by a Maltese court referred to a urgent, temporary arrangement which had since then been lifted. On the other hand, the fact that immediately upon his son’s arrival in Malta the defendant had taken him to be reviewed by a psychologist while opening urgent court proceedings, further indicated that the defendant had premeditated the child’s retention. In addition, the child’s method of schooling whether traditional or at home did not classify as physical and psychological damage as understood by the Convention, especially because home schooling in the US was supervised by the educational authorities. Finally, the child’s request to remain in Malta was in contrast to telephone transcripts seen by the court in which he expressed his longing to return to his siblings in the US. The court therefore accepted the plaintiff’s request and ordered the child back to the US. The court also ordered all court documents pertaining to the child’s educational progress to be handed to the American educational authorities in order to determine the best way forward for the child’s development.

The couple had married some eighteen years prior with the plaintiff being Maltese and the defendant Turkish. The plaintiff had instituted separation proceedings claiming that the marriage had failed due to excesses, threats, cruelty and grievous insults which rendered conjugal life impossible. In addition, the defendant had allegedly also committed adultery and there was an incompatibility of character between the parties. She explained that her husband was very jealous and possessive, feelings exacerbated by his diagnosis of “Othello Syndrome”, a psychopathology by which a person is preoccupied with the thought that their partner is being unfaithful. This fixation was accompanied by instances of physical and psychological violence directed towards both the plaintiff and their children. The defendant’s mental health problems were further exacerbated by repeated alcohol abuse and his refusal to follow medication regimens and therapy sessions. This was confirmed by his psychiatrist who said that the threats of serious violence were partly attributable to the fact that according to his culture it was permissible for someone to end life. Fearful for her and the children’s safety, the plaintiff was forced to abandon the matrimonial home and sought refuge at a woman’s shelter and even though her husband had left for Turkey, the plaintiff refused to return to her home out of fear that she would one day unexpectedly return. The plaintiff therefore requested the court to declare that the marriage had broken down due to reasons entirely attributable to the defendant and grant the personal separation, award her with the exclusive care and custody of their two children, stipulate a maintenance in her favour and liquate the community of acquests. The defendant had been duly notified but refused to take part in proceedings. The court of first instance had found that the marriage had been broken irreparably primarily due to continuous and repetitive abusive behaviour by the defendant. It had ordered the latter to pay 4,295 Maltese lira in maintenance arrears in addition to 10,000 Maltese lira as a lump sum for future maintenance for the mother and children. The court chose the lump sum method because it deemed the defendant unreliable, since in the previous years he had failed to provide any form of financial support in defiance of court orders. The maintenance sum would thereby be deducted from the defendant’s share from the sale of the matrimonial house. It also liquidated the community of acquests and granted the plaintiff sole care and custody of the children. The defendant appealed the sentence challenging the court’s decision to impute the cause of marriage breakdown entirely on him and the extent of the maintenance sum. The Court of Appeal noted how the defendant had not given witness, nor did he produce witnesses, and only produced a letter which had not been taken under oath or signed and therefore could not be taken into consideration. This meant that the lower court had based itself entirely on the plaintiff’s version of events. Based on that evidence, the Court of Appeal felt that the lower court’s assessment had been fair and the defendant could not expect to evade his responsibility of providing financial support to his wife and children by using the strategy of not giving witness. The court said that it was the defendant’s duty to prove that he was unemployed and not the plaintiff’s responsibility to prove the contrary and, even if that was the case, previous court sentences had demonstrated that unemployment was not a valid excuse for not providing maintenance. The lump sum maintenance method had been well justified and represented a future maintenance which had to take into consideration the fact that the matrimonial home had been sold and the plaintiff would need to start paying rent. All this without being eligible for a bank loan due to her unemployment for reasons attributable to her psychiatric illness. The court therefore rejected the appeal and confirmed the lower court’s sentence, with court expenses borne by the defendant.",Maltese,

The plaintiff explained that the couple had married eighteen years prior when he was eighteen years of age and the defendant sixteen, and that the latter agreed to marry him only after repeated insistence on his part. At the time the plaintiff worked for three-month stretches in Libya but the defendant rarely gave the impression to have missed his absence, having spent the period without him in the company of various other persons. After marrying she would often refuse to have intimate relations with him while it took him three years to convince her to have children. They had a baby girl but when it came to the second she allegedly told him that she was not prepared to have more children until he wrote a will in which he bound himself to leave her all of his inheritance. The couple grew further apart with the plaintiff claiming that after the birth of their child he ended up sleeping in the spare bedroom in order to allow the infant to share the bed with the mother. She would spend most of her free time at her mother’s house and would demand money whenever he asked that they have sexual relations together. He ended up filing for separation when he found 2000 Maltese lira (4658.76 euros) missing. The defendant refuted the plaintiff’s claims in their entirety, saying that the marriage was valid in the sense that there been no impairment in her consent as she had been perfectly aware of what she was doing. She entered the marriage willingly and it was the plaintiff’s actions that eventually led to the marriage breakdown. According to her, lack of intimacy was never a problem and they had intimate relations even before marriage was celebrated. The courtship, she said, had been marred by the plaintiff’s infidelity with an English woman. He had promised to cut off all contact but he went against his word. The defendant describes this as a period of great confusion for her but finally gave in and agreed to marry the plaintiff who had used all of his powers of persuasion to convince her. She denied that she had ever not wanted children, recounting to the court the pain and turmoil they went through when she failed to fall pregnant in the first years of their marriage. She contradicted the plaintiff in all his claims, saying that she spent a lot of time with her family because he would always be with his. He had involved himself in politics. He had bought a gun while acting as a canvasser for a renowned politician and occasionally would threaten her with it. In the same period he had started managing the political party’s club leading him to often return home drunk. She refused to be intimate with the plaintiff only after discovering his extra marital affairs with a Maltese and a Bulgarian woman leading him to violently force himself upon her. Following the incident, she had spent a few days living with her parents only to find upon returning that he had changed the lock on the door. She reported the incident to the police who at the time had told her that they could not do anything because they did not have the authority to act upon marital issues. The defendant sought refuge at her parent’s house and her parents gave witness during proceedings confirming their daughter’s version of events. The court started off by saying that plaintiff’s version of events, including those of his witnesses, were not credible as they had conveniently left out all the important events and details mentioned by the defendant. It appeared that he treated his wife as a person subject to his wishes against the fear of violence, both physical and moral. Domestic violence was a prime feature of their marriage. The court said that domestic violence was much more prevalent than imagined with the courts encountering similar situations on a daily basis, meaning that the present laws failed at protecting women and children. During the entire relationship the plaintiff did not have an idea of what the concept of marriage really meant and which certainly did not mean seeking his wife only for intimacy whenever and as often as he wished. This concept of marriage, the court continued, was much nobler than that, meaning communion life between two persons exclusively from other people, in everything and always. This for the plaintiff proved impossible as indicated by the numerous infidelities both before and after marriage which were routinely accompanied by lies and deception. The plaintiff, argued the court, did not even show the necessary respect to the defendant as a human being let alone could he ever intellectually and spiritually conceive the concept of union in love and life. The court felt that for the plaintiff, his wife, and women more generally, were second class citizens and it was this lack of understanding on the essential element of respect which proved that his consent was faulty. He did not in the least respect the dignity of his wife with his emphasis on sex and where women are subservient to her husband. The court argued that such idea of marriage is alien to Maltese culture and law. The court therefore acceded to the plaintiff’s own request and declared the marriage null however with court expenses borne by him.",Maltese,

The company was based in Malta but had a branch office in Libya which offered services in construction projects and provided mixed concrete in Libya. The defendant had been employed as general manager of the company’s operations in Libya and later as project manager of a residential project in the same North African country. He was married to the plaintiff company’s Chairman and according to the latter this was the sole reason why he was employed with the company. The defendant had been employed by the company for ten years but after a detailed analysis of his work he was allegedly discovered carrying out his duties improperly, allowing the company to fall in state of failure and abandonment. In particular, the plaintiff accused the defendant of failing to implement or taking action to address the deficiencies persistently alerted by the auditors in connection to a lack of control and monitoring in connection to the acquisition, storage and dispatch of materials, production of concrete and related products with a result that the plaintiff company suffered substantial loss of cement and other materials. The quantities of concrete used during the production of ready-mix concrete was much larger than necessary, leading to loss of revenue, while the plaintiff further alleged that they were forced to emit large capital to repair apparatus, vehicles and machinery at their batching plant due to his failure to carry out routine and preventive maintenance works. The plaintiffs therefore requested the court to order payment for the damages sustained. The defendant refuted the claims as baseless both in law and fact but before delving into the matter preliminary claimed that Libya, not Malta, had jurisdiction to decide the matter, as he was employed in Libya. The defendant claimed that he originally had a work contract in Malta but subsequently another contract signed in Libya had been carried out because Libyan law required a Libyan work contract for tax purposes and therefore was governed by Libyan employment law. He worked and resided full-time in Libya and only absented himself from the North African country for a short period between February and September 2011 during the Libyan Revolution. The defendant argued that the Maltese courts had no jurisdiction over the case and in fact he had opened unfair dismissal proceedings in Libya claiming internal family disputes motivating the plaintiff’s Chairman want to replace him. The court disputed the defendant’s claims that he was not a resident of Malta and noted that he had failed to proof that his residence had indeed been divided between the United Kingdom and Libya. The court noted how all evidence pointed to the fact that his habitual residence remained Malta. He was a Maltese citizen, his wife resided in Malta, their conjugal residence was in Malta, he received his salary in Euro and in a Maltese bank and continued receiving his payslip at the conjugal home in Malta. He received benefits regulated by Maltese law, he was a Maltese registered employee, he benefited from tax rates applicable to Maltese residents and continued paying his social security contributions in Malta. The length of residence in a country or the fact that person lived abroad was not conclusive criteria in the determination of a person’s domicile because all factors needed to be taken into consideration. He had also failed to prove that his intention had been to make Libya his permanent home. All the witnesses produced, the court continued, contradicted the defendant’s claim that his residence was in Libya. The court was satisfied that the defendant’s domicile remained Malta and the fact that he had initiated judicial proceedings in Libya did not preclude jurisdiction of the Maltese courts. The court therefore rejected the defendant’s objection and ordered the case to continue being heard. Court expenses of this instance borne solely by the defendant.",Maltese,

A few years prior, the couple had sold their matrimonial home in Malta and took their two-year-old daughter with them to Turkey where they instituted their habitual residence. However, the plaintiff alleged that fourteen months later the defendant had illicitly removed the minor from Turkey and brought her to Malta. The plaintiff had been entrusted by Turkish authorities with the duty to commence legal proceedings against the defendant and aid in the return of the child, on the basis that the defendant had retained the child in contravention of the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction and Chapter 410 of the Laws of Malta. The couple was still legally married and while divorce proceedings where underway Turkish courts had issued an injunction against the removal of the children from Turkey until proceedings regarding care and custody of the child were finalised. The plaintiff said that in the meantime the Turkish courts had ordered the child to reside with the father with the defendant given free access rights. The defendant had changed the child’s habitual residence without prior consent from the father and therefore breached his parental authority rights, aggravated by the fact that before removal he was actively exercising these rights according to Turkish law. The defendant rejected the plaintiff’s request claiming that the father had acted prematurely as he had made no attempt to obtain the voluntary return of the minor before initiating proceedings. The defendant noted how the couple had met in Malta and the child was a Maltese citizen, born in Malta, who had resided most of her life in Malta while spending only a trial period of little more than a year in Turkey. She explained that the couple had moved to Turkey due to financial difficulties and a lack of job opportunities and it would not be in the child’s best interests to return to a country where she did not even know the language. In addition, the plaintiff said that the father had failed to inform the court that he had abducted the minor from the house where they temporarily resided in Turkey and kept her hidden, only returning her some six weeks later; a few days before the defendant left for Malta. Contrary to what the father stated claimed the mother, it was she who had custody of the child. The lower court had said that there could be no doubt that Izmir, Turkey was the family’s habitual residence even though the latter concept was given differing definitions across different jurisdictions. However, the court noted how the father had previously taken the law into his own hands when he had arbitrarily decided to take the minor with him and hid her from her mother when the latter had notified her husband that she intended on returning to Malta. The defendant had technically broken the law when she took the minor to another jurisdiction but she did not seem to have had any other legal avenues at her disposal and thus was responding to violence with violence. The lower court said that the plaintiff had failed to prove that according to Turkish Law he had legal custody of the minor and at this stage, after two years residing in Malta, it would be too traumatic to order the child back to Turkey when according to the evidence produced she only spoke the English language. The lower court therefore rejected the plaintiff’s request saying that although the court did not encourage these behaviours by the parents, it had to be said that one could not entirely blame the defendant for her actions based on the circumstances she found herself in. The plaintiff appealed the decision arguing that the lower court had made an incorrect evaluation of the evidence presented. The Court of Appeal echoed the court of first instance in noting that the evidence provided failed to prove that at the moment the alleged retention occurred the father had custody rights over the minor. It was the appellant’s responsibility to prove this fact and could not except the court to take it for granted. The Convention stated that the decision on whether a parent had custodial rights depended entirely on the law of the habitual residence of the minor, in this case Turkey. However, it had not been proven that the father had custodial rights and while this generally occurred through the use of expert witnesses, in this case the appellant had only presented the statements of a Turkish lawyer and that of the father, while nothing was said about the Turkish law applicable in this instance. The father had made an application in front of the Turkish courts in order to obtain interim custody of their daughter and the courts agreed to consider the case but only after a psychological examination of the child. This application cast doubts on the veracity of the father’s claim that when the child had been removed from Turkey he had custodial rights over the child. It was only after the incident that the court issued a temporary provision for the child to stay with the father. In addition, the father had abducted the child and kept her away from her mother for a number of weeks in which the defendant received no help from Turkish authorities. This claim had not been disputed by the appellant, meaning that in absence of an effective intervention available it might be argued that under the present circumstances it would not be in the child’s best interests for her to return to Turkey. The court therefore rejected the appeal and ordered the expenses to be borne by the appellant.",Maltese,

The couple had married in France, spending two years living as a family until the mother took the children with her to Malta, thus removing the minors from their habitual residence of France. The plaintiff had been entrusted by French authorities with the duty to commence legal proceedings against the defendant and aid in the return of the child on the basis that the defendant had retained the children in contravention of the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction and Chapter 410 of the Laws of Malta. The couple were still legally married meaning that a change in the minors’ habitual residence without prior approval from the father was in contravention of Article 372 of France’s Civil Code which stipulated that both parents had equal rights on the minor children. Shared parental authority meant that both parents should exercise their responsibilities without breaching the other parent’s rights. The defendant had acted without the consent of a father who had been exercising his parental rights as granted by the civil law of France. The defendant responded that the plaintiff’s request was groundless both in fact and law, based upon false reporting by her husband. She said she came to Malta with her husband’s consent with the agreement being that she was to remain in her home country because in France there was no one to help her raise their minor twins, especially since the son had been diagnosed with ‘Autism spectrum disorder’ requiring particular care and attention. She explained that almost three years after marrying, the father was required to attend a course in Belgium at a time when she needed his help in raising their one-year old and her in-laws refused to provide assistance. It was in that period that the couple decided that it would be better for the defendant to relocate to Malta. The father had bought the airplane tickets and even paid for someone to accompany the mother because the airline’s policy did not allow for one adult to travel with two infant children. The defendant continued that the agreement had been for her to remain in Malta so much so that he sent her regular maintenance and the couple remained in regular contact. Some three months later, towards the end of that year, he had even told the defendant’s mother that it was better for the children to be raised in Malta because in France they were far from help, while his work constraints kept him away from home for many days at a time. When in Malta, the father himself had signed the applications in order for her to receive children’s allowance and for this to happen they needed to declare that the children’s residence was in Malta. At the start of the new year, the defendant continued, the father had bought the family a television set and issued the licence fee in his name, while a short time later he provided the defendant with a power of attorney which granted her the authorisation to take all the decisions necessary in raising the minors. Around this period he even corresponded with the Institute of Tourism Studies in view of taking a long leave of absence from his current employment in view of commencing tour guide tuition on the Island. Towards the beginning of the following summer the distance between the couple was straining the relationship and although the father continued paying maintenance to his wife, the latter started finding it difficult to contact her husband. This occurred at a time when the son’s developmental condition was becoming more evident with regular visits to educational psychologists, home educators, speech therapists and paediatric gastroenterologists. The defendant felt abandoned and this led her to initiate separation proceedings. A few months later, the father returned to Malta but maintained his position of not providing his wife with any contact details. The defendant recounted how the father had wrote to her praising her accomplishments as a mother and together they had attended consultations with various professionals who saw to their children. Around this time he started telling his wife that it would be better for them to return to France because there the children would be able to receive better care. Even though the couple had started discussing the possibility of him taking long periods off work in order to allow him to spend longer stretches of time in Malta, the plaintiff was surprised when soon after the father initiated proceedings against her, alleging that she had wrongfully retained the children in Malta. The defendant voiced her dismay at the fact that the plaintiff had refused to drop accusations even after she had presented to him all the above documentation to prove her case. The court started by saying that for the plaintiff’s request to be upheld it needed to be proven that the minors had been illicitly removed or retained. From the evidence presented it was clear that this was not the case since the children had arrived in Malta with the couple’s consent and the father only changed his mind when more than a year later their son was diagnosed with autism. At one point the father had even opened a bank account with a local institution and when doing so provided his wife’s address. The court noted that the original plan had been for the defendant to return to France a few months after the start of the new year, as evinced by the airplane tickets acquired. These tickets however had been cancelled and following this date the father had acted in a way which indicated that he had acquiesced for the minors to remain in Malta. The court concluded that even though the father said that he did not consent for the children to remain in Malta, his actions proved otherwise, as acquiescence could be shown by expressed words or conduct which was inconsistent with an intention of the party to insist on his rights and consistent only with an acceptance of the status quo. The Convention stipulated that this acquiescence gave the court the discretion to refuse the return of the minors and in this case the consent of the father for the children to remain in Malta had been successfully demonstrated. In addition, while the father had provided a professional’s opinion which stated that their son would benefit from superior treatment in France, the professionals which regularly see the child in Malta all concurred that the minor was being receptive to the treatment being provided and after more than a year in Malta, it would be detrimental for the minor to change environment, residence and language, amongst other things. This, the court concluded, meant that the risks of transferring the child to France were higher with respect to the potential claims of success that any differing treatment might have. The court therefore rejected the plaintiff’s request and ordered him to bear all court expenses.",Maltese,

The couple had divorced almost two years prior after a ten-year marriage. From this marriage the couple had a child who was born in England, and after a period of residence in Great Britain the couple had relocated to Spain. In fact, the divorce had been granted by the Court of Marbella which had granted care and custody rights to the mother, with regular access to the father, while the patria potestad - the power of deciding for the children- was to be divided equally between both parties. The plaintiff noted how Article 153 of the Spanish Civil Code stipulated that parents who did not live together still shared parental responsibilities and must provide their consent for the minor to leave the country. Article 156 adds that parental responsibility is to be exercised by the parents in unison in regards to issues which affect minors, even when one parent had been given care and custody. The minor in the present case had been removed from his habitual residence in Spain, with the defendant acting without the consent of the child’s father who had been exercising his parental rights as granted by the civil law of Spain. The plaintiff had therefore been tasked by Spanish authorities with the duty to commence legal proceedings against the defendant and aid the child’s return. The defendant objected to the claims saying that she had care and custody of the child and that the laws quoted by the plaintiff were irrelevant to the case in hand because Spanish Law, similarly to the Maltese equivalent, distinguished between custody and parental authority. Apart from that argued the child’s mother, the court still had the discretion to refuse the child’s return when taking into consideration the father’s pathological violent and aggressive nature which risked putting the child in danger. The child was afraid of his father who at times had acted violently even in front of his son, an accusation proven by a Spanish court sentence which had found him guilty of domestic violence. In addition, the mother had no assistance in Spain and was practically homeless, while the father failed to pay maintenance or provide financial assistance for their son’s schooling or medical expenses. This meant that child had been removed from an international school and placed in a Spanish one where the child suffered due to lack of proficiency in the Spanish language. The lower court started by noting that during divorce proceedings the father had expressly requested the court to prohibit the defendant from going abroad, something which the Spanish court had refused. It said that it was the plaintiff’s duty to prove that the defendant did not have the right to change her son’s residence and, after reviewing the Spanish civil code laws quoted by the plaintiff, it came to the conclusion that patria potestas as understood by Spanish jurisprudence differed from that in Malta. This, according to the lower court, was to be considered together with the fact that the defendant did not have a residence or job in Spain, while the father had been found guilty of domestic violence and the child’s return might put him in risk. The lower court therefore refused the plaintiff’s request. The latter appealed the sentence, claiming that the court had made an incorrect evaluation of Spanish law. The Court of Appeal noted that the lower court had failed to consider the father’s rights in light of Maltese law. This was important because since after the divorce the patria potestas was divided between both parents, the effects of this had to be considered in light of both jurisdictions: the Spanish law determines which rights the father still had, and the Maltese to determine whether those rights could be considered “rights of custody”. These rights had autonomous meaning and were not necessarily identical in meaning to that given in the country of habitual residence of the minor. It had been proven that the father had patria potestas rights which under Article 7 of the Maltese Civil Code included the obligations to care, maintain, teach and educate the minor, and therefore it could not be said that he did have custody rights. The Court of Appeal said that this definition did not differ greatly from Article 154 of the Spanish Civil Code, meaning that when the child was removed from his habitual residence the father could no longer exercise his rights and the defendant did not have the right to unilaterally decide where she intended on educating and raising their child. It was only a parent with access rights but no patria potestas who lacked the custody rights necessary to decide upon such issues. The Court of Appeal said that when the Spanish court had decided upon the couple’s divorce, it had handed parental authority to both parties in equal measure and these rights were protected both by Spanish and Maltese law. Apart from that, the child’s interests needed to be examined and safeguarded in the appropriate setting where the minor had habitual residence and not before the court where one parent had fled to. For the child not to be sent back there need to be serious and compelling reasons to justify such a decision, said the court. The Court of Appeal noted that the defendant’s claims regarding the father’s inadequacy as a parent must be dealt with in the Spanish courts. The alleged domestic abuse had been antecedent to the divorce and yet the parents had still agreed to share parental responsibilities which emerged from the patria potestas. The court therefore accepted the plaintiff’s appeal by revoking the lower court’s judgement and ordering the child’s return to Spain. Court expense of both instances borne by the defendant.",Maltese,

The couple had met online and soon after, the mother travelled to Malta for two months to visit him. Upon returning to her home country, she realized that she was pregnant, spurning the defendant to leave Malta in order to be by her side. Once there the father of the child discovered that his partner had another son from a previous marriage who had been placed in foster care and the mother not even having access rights. He came to know of his partner’s serious psychopathologies and upon birth the infant had withdrawal symptoms due to the medications taken by his mother. A few weeks before delivery, the Norwegian Social Services had begun investigating the situation to determine if the mother was a suitable carer for the minor. The couple started worrying that the authorities would remove the child from their care especially because the defendant’s request to remain in Norway to benefit from family reunification had been rejected by Norwegian authorities. The parents therefore conjured up a plan to escape the government’s grasp by travelling to Malta by first taking a ferry to Copenhagen. When this occurred, the minor was just a few days old and, even though they tried to build a family life in Malta, the couple’s relationship soon fell apart and the father was given temporary care and custody. The plaintiff noted how Article 40 of the Norwegian Children Act stipulated that parents who had shared parental responsibilities must provide their consent for the minor to leave the country. Shared parental authority meant that both parents should exercise their responsibilities without breaching the other parent’s rights. The minor had been removed from his habitual residence in Norway with the defendant who had acted without the consent of a mother who had been exercising her parental rights as granted by the civil law of Norway. The plaintiff had therefore been tasked by Norwegian authorities with the duty to commence legal proceedings against the defendant and aid in the return of the child, on the basis that the defendant had retained the child in contravention of the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction and Chapter 410 of the Laws of Malta. The defendant refuted the plaintiff’s claims saying that at no moment had the child been retained illicitly and that the Norwegian authorities had acted upon illegal and clandestine reports of the mother. The latter had agreed to remove the minor from Norway because the parties intended on living together in Malta and for this to happen, she had signed the necessary documentation for the minor to obtain Maltese citizenship. It was therefore incorrect to say that the defendant had removed the child from his habitual residence because the parties had come voluntarily to Malta with the intention of starting their family life on the Island and subsequently the mother had even given her consent for the minor to be in the defendant’s exclusive care and custody. The court started off by saying that the primary issue that needed to be decided upon was the couple’s intentions when the parties arrived in Malta as their versions differed. The father said that they planned on staying in Malta indefinitely while the mother stated that they had planned on returning once the investigation by the Norwegian Social Services was terminated. The latter agency had made contact with the Maltese counterpart advising them to keep an eye on the mother who had suffered from mental problems since childhood and had her previous son removed from her custody after a failed suicide attempt. The chief of medicine of the agency’s psychiatric clinic had cast doubts on the mother’s suitability to care for the infant due to her mental disorder and told the local authorities that the minor might be at risk if left in his mother’s care. This concern was shared by the child’s maternal grandmother who gave witness during proceedings. The court noted that it had to decide whether to order the child’s return to Norway considering the psychological risk involved and that the authorities would most probably not allow the mother to take care of the child while the defendant’s request to reside in Norway on grounds of being family had been refused. The child would therefore end up being placed in foster care just like his step-sibling and this was most certainly not in his best interests. The court had the opportunity to listen to the mother’s testimony viva voce and noted how she was very physically frail, requiring assistance in order to move. The court had also granted her supervised access rights which she had failed to make use of. In addition, the court noted how the couple had arrived to Malta with the intention of settling here as proven by the year-long lease of an apartment and the purchase of relevant appliances upon their arrival. Later, when the relationship ended, the mother had returned to Norway and regularly sent maintenance for the child’s needs. This was further proven by a number of email correspondences and her family’s visit to Malta, all of which indicate that the couple’s intention had been to settle in Malta. The court therefore rejected the plaintiff’s requests.",Maltese,

The plaintiff, a Syrian national, had fled his home country after running over a young boy who had died of his injuries. The plaintiff claimed that he had been harassed and threatened by the boy’s family who had even rejected his father’s monetary compensation as was customary in their culture. Instead they had reiterated they desire to kill him just as he had killed the child. Fearing for his life, the plaintiff had fled the country and relocated to Libya where however he was soon discovered by the boy’s family. At that point the plaintiff obtained a travel visa for Malta where some five years later he applied for asylum. He contested the way the procedure was carried, claiming that when he went to the Commissioner’s office to apply for asylum and was not informed of his rights for representation and instead had been provided with an application to sign in English, a language that he did not understand. A few weeks later, after not having heard from the relevant authorities, he personally went to the defendant Commissioner’s office where he was once again given a paper written in English which informed him that his application had been rejected. He appealed the decision, this time through the service of a lawyer, and requested that he be heard by the Refugee Appeals Boards before giving their final decision on the matter. However, the plaintiff was dismayed to discover that the Board had rejected his appeal without even giving him the opportunity to state his case. The plaintiff therefore claimed that the defendants’ actions had impinged upon is right for a fair trial in breach Article 6 of European Convention on Human Rights and Article 39 of the Constitution of Malta. He further claimed that the application had been rejected because he had applied for refugee status after the maximum time period of two months which he claimed was an incorrect interpretation of the Refugee Act. The defendants refuted the plaintiff’s claims arguing that the quoted laws did not apply because there was no form of contestation in the refugee application process. In addition, all entities acted in accordance to Chapter 420 of the Laws of Malta, while the Board had every right to decide on the matter without hearing the plaintiff. The law gave the Board discretion to decide whether or not to order oral submissions, but in this case it felt that there were enough submissions to arrive to a decision. This did not amount to an unfair hearing especially because the plaintiff’s application had been rejected as he had failed to carry out the necessary procedures within the two-month time limit period applicable at the time and neither entity had felt that there were special circumstances deserving of an exception to the rule. The defendants also rejected the plaintiff’s claims that he had not been offered legal assistance. They rebutted that the plaintiff had been asked if he could read and, since the answer was in the affirmative, they had provided him with a document in the Arabic language which informed him of his rights and likewise, in Arabic the decision to reject his application. The court quoted copious local and European case law which confirmed the defendant’s clams that proceedings concerning political asylum, a request for a residence permit or expulsion of an alien did not involve determination either of the alien’s civil rights or obligations, or of a criminal charge within the meaning of Article 6 of the Convention. The request for refugee status is not a procedure which involves a form of contestation, while the law which dealt with civil rights and obligations only talked about the right of application for status. The law stated that protection could be unilaterally revoked and therefore could not be considered a civil right. Moreover, the plaintiff had resided illegally in Malta for more than five years and only applied for asylum five days after being informed by the police that he was going to be deported. The court therefore rejected the plaintiff’s request and ordered him to bear all court expenses.",Maltese,
MT175,2019.11.14,948/09 FDP,,,Qorti Civili Prim Awla,Malta,https://ecourts.gov.mt/onlineservices/Judgements/Details?JudgementId=0&CaseJudgementId=119225,Healthcare professional; medical intervention; Medical council; fine; suspension; Dutch culture; natural justice,contracts and obligations law,"The plaintiff appealed a decision by the Malta Medical Council imposing on her a three-month suspension and a fine of €10,000 for failing to carry out an operation she had been contracted to do. The plaintiff was a Dutch neurosurgeon who had been working in Malta for twelve years. On the day, the plaintiff was to operate on a patient immediately following an intervention on the same person by an orthopaedic colleague. She requested that the operation be held first thing in the morning but that same day she was informed that she would have to attend at 13:30 because it had not indeed been the first operation of the day as the other surgeon had to carry out an arthroscopy on another person. This amounted to a delay of an hour and a half and upon hearing the news the plaintiff stormed off, failing to turn up to the operating theatre. The defendant Council had found the plaintiff’s conduct in breach of the Article 6(iv) of the General Notice for the Guidance of Practitioners and Article 5 of the Ethics for the Medical Profession. The plaintiff claimed that her decision not to carry out the operation was justified and, even if it were not, the punishment was not justified. She noted that while she was in the wrong by leaving the hospital in the manner she did, there were a number of factors which led her to do so. She had expressly asked for the operation to be carried out first thing in the morning but had been ignored, while she had other patients to care for and a sick husband who depended on her help. In addition, since the last time she had consulted with the patient and colleagues, she had changed her mind about the intervention and decided that it would be better if the neurosurgical intervention was not carried out. She conceded that she should have informed every party involved of her change of mind but nonetheless contended that her decision to leave did not in actual fact affect the patient. The plaintiff said that after careful consideration she believed that the balance of her responsibilities weighed in favour of her husband and her other patients against her judgement that an intervention was unlikely of any benefit to the patient. There had not been a breach of contract or ethical rules, she claimed, if she proved that the non-carrying out of the operation was reasonably justified. She claimed that her attitude was influenced by a cultural factor as she had graduated and worked in the area for sixteen years in the Netherlands before relocating to Malta. The defendant Council rejected the plaintiff’s claims saying that the court had no jurisdiction to decide upon their decision on the basis of Chapter 464 of the Laws of Malta, the Medical Professions Act, which defined “professional and ethical standards” relating to the general conduct of a health care professions, including the behaviour of members towards their clients or patients under their care, as well as the behaviour of such members towards other members of same profession, other health care workers and towards the society. In addition, among it functions, the Medical Council was to prescribe and maintain professional and ethical standards; the ethical standards and the reasoning behind them were not decided by medical persons or by their culture but held and set by the Council. In this regard, the law vested the Medical Council with exclusive power, authority and responsibility to enforce these standards and gave exclusive jurisdiction to the Council to investigate any allegation of professional misconduct or breach of the code of ethics by professionals falling under its supervision. The law in question even stipulated the penalties that the Council must impose on grounds of conviction, giving it exclusive jurisdiction even in this regard. The defendant Council had claimed in its judgement that the plaintiff had acted in breach of professional conduct and against ethical and professional standards when she failed to turn up for her part of the operation on a patient who was already incised. She had allowed her rage and personal agenda to take over the patient’s interests at the moment when he was being operated. The defendant council had noted that the plaintiff had defended herself by saying that operation was no longer needed but it was evident that this attitude was adopted at the moment when she decided to quit, as a means of self-justification and the Council noted that during questioning the plaintiff had made it abundantly clear that her sense of duty and concern had been replaced by anger because things did not go according to plan. The bond of trust between the patient and his doctor had been broken. Prior to the defendant’s decision, the orthopaedic surgeon who had intervened on the patient before the plaintiff’s slot had given witness claiming that the defendant’s actions gave a bad example to the junior doctors, that the patient had remained open for a longer time than necessary and that the operation could not be carried out by anybody else since only the plaintiff had the necessary expertise to carry out such a major operation. Another witness said that it was the norm for reason of logistics and economising on time for a minor operation to be performed while preparing for a major operation. In the case at hand there had also been delays because the patient was obese and the anaesthesia took longer time to work. There were also no time limits set on operations as each case was different and cause great variations in time. The court started off by recognising the defendant’s exclusive jurisdiction on the matter and said that the court’s role in the matter was limited to appraising the procedures held before the Council to confirm that it acted within the powers conferred to it by the law, while assessing that it had acted in accordance with the principles of natural justice, determining whether the decision was reasonable and if the defendant had made a correct interpretation of the applicable law. The court concluded that the Council had acted within the powers conferred to it and with principles of natural justice. The plaintiff had been granted the possibility to put forward her defence in view of the accusations levelled against her and which she had been well aware of before. She had been present when all the witnesses were questioned and was given the right to legal representation in addition to the opportunity to question the witnesses herself. The court noted how it was within the sole discretion of the Council as to what the pecuniary penalty was to be as long as it did not surpass the €20,000 limit. The penalty imposed was deemed reasonable and within the remit granted to the defendant, while the Council was also entitled to struck someone off the registry for such period of time as it deemed it necessary, with no time limit being set in law. The court said that in light of the prior considerations there did not exist sufficient grounds for the court to alter the decision taken by the Medical Council. It therefore rejected the plaintiff’s claims but ordered court expenses to be divided between the parties.",English,

The couple had started their relationship six years prior when the mother had travelled to Malta in order to be with the defendant. It was an unstable relationship during which period the mother would pendulum between Malta and her home country and it was on one of these occasions back in Poland that she discovered that she was pregnant. She returned to Malta and gave birth to their son on the Island. A few months later she returned to her country and this time it was the defendant who travelled to be with his family. It was at this moment that the mother told him that she did not intend on returning to Malta if beforehand they did not sign an agreement stipulating the care and custody of the child. The couple agreed to an arrangement which granted the mother care and custody of the child, while the father had free access. The mother retuned to Malta in an attempt to save the relationship while attempting to raise the child in a family environment. However, a few months later the relationship ended for good, with the mother who left for Poland and then meeting a Polish partner. It was during one of these access periods over the Christmas holidays that the defendant had failed to return the child to Poland, instead deciding to register him in a Maltese school. The plaintiff had therefore been tasked by Polish authorities with the duty to commence legal proceedings against the defendant and aid in the return of the child, on the basis that the defendant had retained the child in contravention of the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction and Chapter 410 of the Laws of Malta. The plaintiff noted how the defendant had breached the signed agreement by removing the minor from his habitual residence in Poland, with the defendant who had acted without the consent of a mother who had been regularly exercising her parental authority. The mother had made numerous attempts to save the relationship but had called it off when she discovered that the defendant was having an affair. The defendant rebutted that it was not correct to say that Poland was the child’s habitual residence as he had been born in Malta and spent most of his five years of age on the Island. The retainment, according to the defendant father, had not occurred careless but only in order to safeguard the best interests of the minor who showed great reluctance to return to his mother in Poland. Forced return would expose him to the risk of psychological damage or an intolerable situation. The defendant said he never had the intention of accepting to relinquish care and custody of the child, only acquiescing to it because the mother, while in Poland, had been making it very difficult for him to see the child and it was in this context of protecting his access rights that he had agreed. He also claimed that the environment he could offer in Malta was much superior to the life that awaited him in Poland. The court started by saying that there could be no doubt that care and custody of the child had been an exclusive right of the mother, with the signed agreement not being a temporary provision. The defendant’s claims that he had no intention of agreeing to the arrangement were questionable because he had been assisted by a lawyer, there was no supernatural force that coerced him into signing and had he really disagreed with the provisions he could have protected his rights in the Polish courts. It seemed clear to the court that at the time the defendant had signed the agreement because it was convenient for him to be given ample access rights to the child. Neither could there be any doubt that the minor’s habitual residence was Poland as the mother had proven that her intention had been to settle permanently in Poland after failed attempts of reconciliation. This included working in Poland, registering the child to a Polish school and starting new a relationship with a co-national. The court also threw out the defendant claims of psychological risk saying that he had failed to prove his case, while at the same time a child of five years of age was far too young and immature to decide upon such a sensitive topic. The court therefore acceded to the plaintiff’s request and ordered the minor back to Poland with court expenses borne by the defendant.",Maltese,

The defendant had a tumultuous relationship with a Polish woman and this was characterised by various attempts of reconciliation. When these failed, the mother took their son to her home country of Poland where she intended to make her habitual residence. A court in Gdynia, Poland, had stipulated that the mother was to have care and custody of the child, while the defendant was to have access during the minor’s school holidays. However, during one of these access periods, the defendant had failed to return the child and the plaintiff Director of the Department for Social Welfare Standards was entrusted with the duty to commence legal proceedings against him. The plaintiff had claimed that the defendant’s actions were in breach of Articles 3 and 7 of the, as well as Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 of 27 November 2003 concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters. On the other hand, the defendant claimed that the five-year old’s habitual residence was not in Poland as he had spent the majority of this early years in Malta. He said that he had retained their son due to the minor’s own insistence and reluctance to be return to his mother’s home country and that he had taken the necessary actions in the best interest of the child. He was a Maltese citizen and his return to Poland would cause psychological damage. The lower court found the plaintiff’s actions to be successful as the minor’s habitual residence was in Poland, the mother had care and custody rights and that with his retention in Malta the mother’s rights would be violated. The court had noted that the couple’s relationship had been difficult with the mother who for various periods of time had made attempts to settle in Malta in order to have a family life with the defendant and their son. However, the legal requirements for a habitual residence were not based on long periods of time in the same place, but rather the intention of being in a place with the desire to settle there. In this case, there could be no doubt that the minor’s mother had started a new life in her home country where she had also entered a new relationship. In addition, had the defendant not agreed with the access rights awarded to him, he had every right to seek recourse in the relevant courts of both Malta and Poland. There also could be no doubt that the mother’s rights would be breached if the child remained in Malta. The lower court explained that the Convention’s article on psychological harm must be applied only in exceptional circumstances because otherwise it would end up nullifying the intentions of the Convention as a whole. It noted how the defendant had failed to prove the damage that would be caused to the child should he return to Poland and the child did not have the age or maturity necessary to decide where his habitual residence. The defendant appealed the sentence making numerous objections, in particular that the child’s habitual residence was not Poland. The Court of Appeal said that the prime carer and custodian of the child had ample discretion where to raise the child and the habitual residence need not be permanent. In addition, the child had satisfied the criteria for integration in Poland in the sense that he was a Polish citizen, attended the same school since the age of three. He also attended Judo lessons and Speech therapy sessions as well as English language private lessons. The child’s supreme interest dictated that they must be examined and protected in the relevant courts of his habitual residence and not in the courts of the country where the parent escapes to, otherwise it would be incentivising and awarding the arrogance and the illegal abduction of the child in clear opposition to the child’s best interests. The defendant had failed to prove that life in Poland was much worse than that in Poland and the latter country was a civilised nation, with a high regard towards the value of family life and ethical values similar to those in Malta. Removing him clandestinely and deceptively from his country of residence, is clearly not in the interest of the child. The Court of Appeal also refused to change the sentence on the basis of the allegation that the child wishes to remain in Malta. The child was young, enjoying the Maltese summer, swimming and surely pampering by the defendant’s family. The court argued it should not base its judgement on this ephemeral feeling. The Court of Appeal therefore confirmed the lower court’s sentence and ordered the child to be returned to Poland, with court expenses borne by the appellant.",Maltese,

The Maltese couple had emigrated to London with the intention of working and settling in the UK. They took their minor child with them who was enlisted in an English school while the parents received benefits during a period of unemployment. In order to do this, the father left his full-time job in Malta, and all of his possessions to work in England. However, a year and three months after relocating, the relationship had ended and while the father remained at the family’s residence, the mother found a place of her own and had enlisted in the University for a philosophy course lasting three years. The parents did not undergo any formal process for the care and custody of the child and verbally agreed for her to reside with her mother with ample access for the father. They had tried to reconcile during a summer visit to Malta during which they attended for their native village feast but this only served to exacerbate the difficulties they were experiencing and upon returning to England their relationship was over. Subsequently, during the Christmas period, the defendant contacted the father to ask for permission to take their daughter to Malta for the Christmas period. He had acceded to her request believing that it was beneficial for their child to be in the company of the grandparents. The defendant however did not return and the Director of the Department for Social Welfare Standards was entrusted by English authorities with the duty to commence legal proceedings against the defendant and aid in the return of the child. The plaintiff argued that the defendant had uprooted the child from her habitual residence without prior consent from the father and needed to be returned to the UK. The defendant rejected these claims saying that London was not the child’s habitual residence and that they had gone to the UK for a sort of trial period with the idea of returning to Malta once financially stable. She said that the father had agreed for the child’s travel documents to be in her possession and that her intention of not settling in London should be noted from the fact that she did not have a job and had spent a period of time living off social benefits. She presented a letter which proved that she had sought the opinion of the Citizens Advice Bureau which had told her that she had every right to travel with the child. The court noted that after the relationship had ended, the defendant had not returned immediately to Malta, but had instead rented out a place and continued attending University. The court also took note of the defendant’s University registration for a course of three years, the child’s admission to school, their registration with the NHS and the payment of the TV licence all indicated that the couple had not gone to England for a holiday but had the intention of settling there for a number of years. No formal proceedings had been carried out regarding the care and custody of the child and therefore both enjoyed parental rights according to Articles 2(2) and 4(1)(a) of the 1989 Children Act of the United Kingdom. The opinion sought by the mother from the Bureau, apart from not being a legal opinion, showed she had not been entirely sincere with them because at no point is the father’s consent discussed. In fact, it also served to indicate that the defendant knew she was planning on doing something illicit and obtained this opinion in order to legitimise her decision. The court therefore acceded to the plaintiff’s request and ordered the child back. The defendant appealed the sentence saying that the court had made an erroneous evaluation of the evidence, especially the belief that London was the family’s habitual residence as it was never their plan to remain in the UK indefinitely. The Court of Appeal started off by saying that according to English doctrine, which the court agreed with, the concept of habitual residence did not require an indefinite timeframe but simply the idea of going to a place for purpose of settling. Temporary residences for education, work or business can lead to changes in an individual’s habitual residence and for the law to be satisfied in this regarded it just needs to be proven that residence occurred for an appreciable period of time. The evidence brought forward indicated that the couple had left everything behind them in order to settle in the UK and even though it was not excluded that they might return to Malta in the future, in the moment when the child was retained in Malta, the habitual residence of the parents was in England. The court also rejected the defendant’s claim that the return would constitute a serious risk for the child saying that in England there were adequate procedures to ensure that the child’s rights were protected. The court therefore confirmed the lower court’s sentence and ordered the plaintiff to bear court expenses of both instances.",Maltese,

He was wanted by the Republic of Turkey for the alleged voluntary murder of a British national during a holiday in Istanbul who was killed after a stone was throw at his head. The lower court had decided that there existed more than enough prima facie evidence that the defendant had committed the act and ordered him arrested in view of sending him back to Turkey. The defendant appealed saying that the Maltese Government could not invoke the ‘European Convention on Extradition’ because it had not been ratified into Maltese law as required by the Ratification of Treaties Act and therefore the lower court did not have the jurisdiction to order his arrest and deportation. In addition, the accused argued that the treaty needed to be ratified by a Parliamentary resolution which had not occurred, rendering the Convention inapplicable. He also claimed that the lower court had mistakenly considered the evidence brought forward by the Maltese police when it should have based its considerations entirely on the evidence provided by the Turkish authorities. Also, there could not be any certainty that the identity of the person requested by Turkish authorities corresponded to that of the appellant, while Maltese courts could not allow a person to face justice in Turkey because of the risk that a death penalty is imposed which goes against all Maltese beliefs of fundamental rights and human dignity intrinsic to Maltese law and cultural beliefs. The court threw out the appellant’s claim that the European Convention on Extradition’ required ratification according to the relevant Maltese Act since the law only required the ratification of a certain number of treaties specifically enlisted in the Act. A government official took the stand to confirm that Malta was indeed a signatory to the treaty, meaning that there could be no doubt that Malta was bound on an international level by the Convention and thereby the Maltese courts did indeed have jurisdiction on the matter. The court said that while it was true that oftentimes the evidence was provided mostly, if not entirely, by the requesting country, in this case Turkey, this did not preclude Malta from providing evidence of its own. In cases of extradition, local authorities represented by the police and Attorney General took the place of the requesting authorities and if they obtained any evidence, they were bound to present it. The court had every right to hear viva voce witness accounts especially when considering that the single most important evidence was provided by the police when the appellant admitted under interrogation by Maltese authorities to having hit the victim in the head with a stone. The court noted that this modus operandi was in accordance with local law, the Convention and even English law, as often evidenced by the English Court of Committal. The court also rejected the appellant’s claim of mistaken identity, while refusing to intervene on the defendant’s hypothetical risk of facing the death penalty in Turkey. It said that this was rather a political issue which the Ministry responsible for deporting the plaintiff had certainly taken into consideration before filing the proceedings with the court. Nonetheless, the law did not forbid the court from granting extradition in cases in which the defendant risked death penalty but gave the authorities the permission to demand guarantees from the requesting country in this regard; something that the Maltese government had not deemed necessary in this particular case. The court therefore rejected the defendant’s appeal and confirmed the lower court’s decision, with court expenses borne by the appellant.",Maltese,

The plaintiff had travelled to her native country Malta with the couple’s two-year-old and six-month-old children with the father’s consent, but had failed to return to their country of habitual residence. The father had reached out to the Belgian authorities who in turn entrusted the plaintiff with the responsibility of taking the necessary actions in front of the local courts. The plaintiff explained that the couple had an understanding that the defendant would return to Belgium following the European Parliament elections and that her unilateral decision constituted illegal retention in breach of the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction and of The Child Abduction and Custody Act of the Laws of Malta. According to the Belgian Civil Code the parents enjoyed and exercised joint care and custody over the two minors and the defendant’s actions were in breach of the father’s rights. The defendant rejected the claims arguing that the father had consented or subsequently acquiesced to the removal or retention and denied that there had been any agreement with the father for their return after the European elections. She said that the couple had agreed for her to come to Malta with the children for an indefinite period of time after discovering her husband’s infidelity. In fact, the defendant continued, the father invoked the Convention only after the plaintiff had filed for personal separation before the Maltese courts and requested for sole care and custody of the children. The court started by saying that it was not contested that the children’s habitual residence was Belgium and the fact that no specific date had been set for their return did not mean that the father had agreed to an indefinite stay in Malta. The defendant had unliterally made up her mind not to return and the father was well within his rights to protest the unlawful retention which breached his parental and custodial rights over his children. The court added that it needed to address the period between the defendant’s unlawful retention and the moment the father’s decided to seek legal redress in order to determine whether he had in fact acquiesced to their stay in Malta. The court noted how the couple had long discussed relocating to the defendant’s native country in order to try and save their marriage. When the defendant arrived in Malta the conversations on the topic were in full throttle and in fact the father had started applying for job positions on the Island. By the court’s assessment, around five or six months later the defendant was aware that his wife would not return voluntarily to Belgium and around this period he started warning her about invoking the Convention. In particular, the father threatened the defendant with the Hague Convention not in the event that she did not return to Belgium, but if they failed to reach an amicable settlement regarding the custody of their children. At this stage, he was therefore worried about his parental rights and was prepared to accept a permanent relocation to Malta so much so that the father kept applying for jobs in Malta until around eight months after the defendant had arrived in Malta. Apart from this, he was advertising the couple’s matrimonial home in Belgium in view of renting it out and he also promoted his wife’s curriculum vitae for a job in Malta. This meant that while the defendant unlawfully retained the children in Malta, by his words and actions the father had subsequently acquiesced as defined by Article 13 of the Convention. The court said that therefore, once acquiesced there is no turning back. The court rejected the plaintiff’s request for return of the children to Belgium and costs were to be borne by the plaintiff.",English,

The plaintiff alleged that the charges were aggravated by the fact that they were motivated by race or religion. The defendant, a Libyan national, was also accused of breaking the public order and peace, while also being a recidivist. The defendant pleaded not guilty to the charges brought against him but the court noted that during his testimony he had confirmed to having carried out the acts he was accused of. However, the defendant’s motive seemed entirely political in protest towards the Gaddafi regime as it occurred around the time when the revolutionary protests were ongoing in Libya. The plaintiff in turn had failed to prove the racial or religious motivating factors.

The plaintiff explained that the couple formed by a New Zealander father and a Saudi national mother had separated after a nine year marriage, during which period they had two children. After three years working and living in Saudi Arabia, the couple had relocated to New Zealand which then constituted the children’s habitual residence. According to New Zealand Law, he shared care and custody of the children with the defendant and this was no longer possible when she unilaterally decided to relocate to Malta with her new partner. The parties had a flexible arrangement for the children to travel overseas with either of them and on this occasion the father had agreed for the children to visit their grandparents in Saudi Arabia. He maintained regular contact with the children and started suspecting that they would not be returning to New Zealand. He contacted the defendant by email who told him that they had just arrived in Malta and intended on settling there. He immediately initiated proceedings and the plaintiff was instructed by New Zealand authorities to ensure the children’s return on the basis that the defendant’s actions had infringed the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction and the Child Abduction and Custody Act of Chapter 410 of the Laws of Malta. The defendant rebutted the plaintiff’s claims saying that she was afforded sole care and custody of the children and, even though they currently reside in Malta, she had no intention of depriving the father from access to the children. She claimed to have been authorised by the father to travel abroad with the children and had not been bound by any agreement to return the minors. She said that there was no judicial order or legal disposition which prohibited her from travelling with the children and the father was not in a position to care and support the children due to his financial difficulties. The court started by saying that for the applicant to succeed in this request he must prove that the children’s habitual residence was New Zealand and that the father enjoyed parental rights, and moreover, that he had not consented to the children being retained in Malta. The court noted how the father had signed a written authorisation for the children to travel and even took them to the airport but was not aware of their subsequent travels to Malta, and much less of the defendant’s intention not to return them to New Zealand. In fact, he got to know that the children were in Malta only after they had actually arrived. Even though the agreement did not include a return date, this did not mean that the father approved that they leave New Zealand indefinitely and he had every reason to believe that it was a short visit to their grandparents in Saudi Arabia. Similarly, even the children’s school in New Zealand knew that they would be away but had not been informed of the duration. In addition, there was no doubt that New Zealand was their habitual residence and they had spent only their first years in Saudi Arabia. In New Zealand they attended school and numerous other extra circular activities such as dancing lessons and were in contact with their extended families. Also, there was no court order granting care and custody solely to the defendant and New Zealand law stipulated that these responsibilities were to be shared because the children were born in wedlock. The court said both parties had presented an agreement which stipulated that the parents shared rights and obligations, meaning that in order to change the country of residence of the children, consent of the father was necessary. The father was very active in the children’s upbringing and exercised his parental rights before the departure of the children and even after, he maintained regular contact. The court noted a certain inconsistency in the defendant’s statement as she did not seem to have a clear idea of where she intended to settle, confirming the fact that her decision had been unilateral, with no consultation with the father. The defendant actions were in breach of the father’s rights, who had acted immediately when he discovered that she had retained the children in Malta. There was no physical or psychological risk for the children’s return to New Zealand and any eventual changes in the care and custody of the children should be dealt with by the relevant New Zealand courts. The court therefore acceded to the plaintiff’s request and ordered the children back to New Zealand. Court expenses borne by the defendant.",English,

The couple had married four years prior and had a daughter who at the time was three years of age. The defendant, a French national, was seven years older than the plaintiff and had just emerged from another marriage from which she had a seventeen year old child. The court felt that these differences represented the main problematics of their relationship, together with an evident language barrier and a different approach to life. The court said that notwithstanding these differences, the plaintiff still went along with the marriage because he felt that defendant succeeded in releasing all his build-up pressure and in her he found the only avenue to escape his family problems. This led him to be greatly infatuated by a person he knew nothing about so much so that as more time progressed, he realised that most of what she had told him about herself was very different from reality. The plaintiff failed to take into consideration the differences in environment, culture, country of origin and civil status. The court felt that his confusion progressed into the present day, finding him very uncertain on both the past and the future. No doubt however, continued the court, that he had used marriage as refuge from his family issues. The court felt that he was not capable of providing uninhibited consent, which in turn affected his discretion of judgment on the matrimonial life and its essential elements. In that point of his life and with the infatuation he had for the defendant who represented more of a mother figure than a partner, he was incapable of accepting his obligations in marriage. The court noted how on the other hand, based on the evidence, the defendant was completely free in her consent and in the plaintiff she saw an opportunity to start afresh after a failed marriage. Seeing how infatuated he was, she decided to have a child with him, without the least intention to observe the essential elements of marriage, including that of permanence and indissolubility. The court therefore acceded to the plaintiff’s request and declared the marriage null, with court expenses divided between the parties. The defendant did not take part in proceedings.",Maltese,

The couple had met twelve years prior when the plaintiff was thirteen years old and the defendant nineteen. They got married four years later and from this marriage the couple had two children. The plaintiff recounted that the defendant had always had a gambling addiction but around a year and a half after making acquaintance he told her that he had started studying the Bible with the Jehovah’s Witnesses and this had helped him overcome his habits of smoking and gambling. The plaintiff had initially resisted because she had been raised in a Roman Catholic household but when he told her that he would not continue with the relationship unless she too became an adherent, she felt compelled to oblige and begrudgingly started attending sessions with the defendant. This caused great friction with her parents who were devout Catholics and refused to accept her change of denomination. They burned her Bible, locked her indoors, beat her and even threatened to kick her out of the house if she continued her relationship with the defendant. These problems made her want to escape what she felt as oppressive behaviour on part of her parents, leading her to propose to the defendant for them to get engaged. He accepted only on the condition that their children are raised in the Jehovah’s Witnesses faith and not baptised in Church, while on her part she made him promise to her that he would end all gambling habits. The plaintiff said that at the time of marriage she was seventeen years old and in hindsight she realises that at that age she could never comprehend the responsibilities and problems of married life. She had wanted to get married in Church but instead accepted the defendant’s conditions because she was young, immature and easy to manipulate. She explained that once she started attending the Jehovah’s meetings it was not easy to leave because they would place great pressure on her by claiming that whoever left would spiritually die. The situation at home had worsened to such a degree that she would spend all day away because her parents refused to speak to her, and when they did, their interactions were always characterised by fighting. The plaintiff claimed that things changed rapidly after marriage as the defendant became violent and abusive. She recounted numerous incidents such as when he threw a knife at her, beat her in front of her sister or bought a hunting rifle and threatened to use it against her. She refused to have children at such a young age and claimed that he would force himself upon her to ensure that she falls pregnant. His violence had erupted when he discovered that she was taking the contraceptive pill and forced her to stop taking it. After three years in the abusive marriage during which the defendant had restarted gambling, she left home but was soon forced to return because she did not have anywhere to go, with no money of her own and parents who refused to take her back in. Within the span of months, she gave birth to their two children but the situation did not get any better and the plaintiff claimed to have cried when she discovered she was pregnant for a second time. The defendant’s control over the plaintiff was described as mental and physical abuse, until one day the defendant told her that he was leaving. This represented a great relief for her, so much so that she told him that he could leave that same day and that was what he did. He told her that he had been living a double life all along and had never really forgone the vices he promised. The defendant agreed with the plaintiff’s request for annulment but rejected her claims and said that the marriage had failed due to reasons entirely attributable to her. He claimed that after marriage the plaintiff had started acting aggressively, became short-tempered and would spend long period of time away from home. She told him that she had never intended to have children as they represented an unbearable burden at her young age. When they did finally have children he had caught her raising her hands upon them, leading him to seek psychiatric help for her even though she refused to take the medication prescribed. A Catholic priest, who had been involved in the couple’s turbulent relationship even before they had married, told the court that the plaintiff had told him that she will try to change the defendant’s mind regarding religion and bring him closer to Catholicism. The priest at the time had professed his doubts because according to him the Jehovah’s Witnesses faith was not amenable to dialogue. The court started by saying that there could be no doubt that the plaintiff was immature, leading the defendant to have control over her on every issue at hand. In fact, he acted as her superior and not as her partner. On the other hand, the defendant had deceived the plaintiff by promising to change his habits but only admitted to having remained the same after marriage had ended. There was also a radical change in his attitude which indicated that he had not been honest with the plaintiff before her consent to marriage was given. The court said that according to the evidence all four elements of deceit as understood by the law were satisfied and this deceit ended up hindering married life. There could be no doubt that this was a big issue between the parties and the fact that the defendant, not only failed at beating off his habits but also never even attempted to do so, indicated that he had willingly misled the plaintiff thus vitiating her consent. Not only did the plaintiff not have the mental maturity to provide valid consent to marriage but the same consent had not been given freely and consciously for all that was required by the bond of marriage. She lacked the mental capacity necessary to reflect on the obligations, duties and responsibilities which came with marriage and above all there had been no preparation, reflection or appreciation of the responsibilities derived from the decision to marry. The court therefore acceded to the plaintiff’s request and granted the annulment of the marriage, with the court expenses divided between both parties.",Maltese,

The plaintiff husband, a Libyan national, explained that the authentic translation from Arabic of his birth certificate contained errors which were then passed on to his wife and children. In fact, his full name was erroneously written and had been since copied in his marriage certificate and the birth certificates of all his children. On the couple’s marriage certificate, the husband’s father was listed in another way, giving way to three different versions of the same surname. In addition, on their daughter’s birth certificate the plaintiff husband’s surname was indicated as being her father’s name, when the correct surname given to the minor should have simply been one. The defendant noted that it had no objection to carrying out the necessary changes as long as the court was sufficiently satisfied that the plaintiff husband’s full name was indeed as he declared. He stressed that whatever the court’s decision, he should not be held responsible for the court expenses because no error had been committed on his end. He had worked upon the translations provided by the plaintiffs themselves and issued by the Maltese Consulate in Tripoli.

The same name and surname now claimed to be erroneous were also found on the plaintiff’s passport and residency permits. Similarly, the details written on the daughter’s birth certificate was based upon the documentation provided by the plaintiff husband on the day. The court sought the help of an expert translator from Arabic to English in order to ensure the plaintiff’s correct name. After reviewing all the relevant documentation, the translator said that there could be no doubt that the plaintiff husband’s correct surname was as he stated, meaning that even his passport was incorrect.

The parents explained that due to the error their son’s surname was indicated as being his father’s actual name. The couple admitted that they did not understand English or Maltese and when it came to signing the child’s birth document they did not know what they were agreeing to. The plaintiffs noted that it was in the child’s best interests for the records to accurately reflect his details and requested the court to carry out the necessary changes to the child’s birth certificate and all civil documentation. The defendant noted the discrepancy that existed in various records pertaining to the father with a few which indicated his surname differently. In particular, in the application filed with the Refugee Commissioner upon entry into Malta he had declared that his ‘Family Name’ was otherwise. After taking note of the couple’s marriage certificate translation presented as evidence and which listed father’s name in the correct form, the defendant recommended the court to obtain further documentation including the plaintiff’s original birth and marriage certificates and Family Book.

The plaintiff, a Maltese national, had relocated to Malta with the child she shared with the defendant after the couple had agreed for them to temporarily reside on Island and return to Belgium once the scholastic year was over. However, a few months into their stay in Malta, the plaintiff had filed for personal separation from the defendant. In addition, she requested the court to declare that the child’s habitual residence was Malta, while granting her care and custody of the child, together with a regular maintenance from the defendant. The defendant had open concurrent divorce proceedings in Belgium which had noted that while the child’s habitual residence was Belgium, the separation proceedings had been first filed in Malta and, based on the rule of first seized, the issue had to be decided by the Maltese courts, while it left in the latter’s hands to decide whose responsibility it was to decide upon the care and custody of the child. The Maltese counterparts in turn decided that they had jurisdiction to decide upon the couple’s divorce but that the child had been wrongfully detained in Malta as the plaintiff had failed to return to Belgium after the agreed period of residence in Malta had expired. The court therefore said that while it would deal with the couple’s divorce proceedings, it ordered the child back to his habitual residence of Belgium. The plaintiff appealed this decision claiming that the court had made an incorrect evaluation of the law and said that the court had to take into consideration both the factors connecting the child to a particular country, but also the best interests of the child. The Court of Appeal noted that after the judgement the plaintiff had returned to Belgium where the parents lived a short distance from each other allowing both parties to exercise their care and custody rights. The court said that apart from the one scholastic year spent in Malta, and the subsequent time until the court ordered the child back to Belgium, the child had always lived in Belgium which was therefore his habitual residence. This meant that the Belgian courts were in a better position to decide upon the care and custody of the child. The Court of Appeal said that appellant had failed to provide convincing reasons as to why this decision should be changed. The child attended a Belgian school and his social contacts were all in that country as he had been raised for many years in the Belgian social and cultural environment. This meant that the Maltese courts were not in the best position to decide what was in the minor’s best interest. The court therefore rejected the appeal, while reminding the plaintiff that for convenience sake they could stop divorce proceedings in Malta and reinstitute them in their country of residence.

The issue stemmed from the defendant’s refusal to turn up for jury duty, resulting in a fine of 100 Maltese lira (€232.94). He refused to pay it and the plaintiff Court Registrar initiated court proceedings for the fine to be converted into an effective prison term. The defendant sought recourse in front of the lower court claiming that he was discriminated against because he was subject to a disproportionate responsibility and burden when compared to other persons and because the law or administrative practice exempted persons of female sex from carrying out jury duties while men did not benefit from such exemptions. He claimed that this was in breach of Article 45 of the Constitution of Malta and Article 14 of the European Convention of Human Rights. The lower court had noted that Title VI of the Criminal Code which dealt with the jury selection process defined that every Maltese citizen of either sex and over the age of twenty-one qualified to serve as juror, meaning that the law did not make any distinction between persons who were to serve. Therefore, there could not be said to be any discrimination in the law. At most it could be alleged that there were discriminatory administrative procedures but it had been proven that the list of persons eligible for duty was updated every year, with district police who provided replacements for person who either died or relocated abroad. These people were vetted and included in the list irrespective of their gender. The lower court said that the defendant had failed to prove that any form of discrimination was carried out or that some persons managed to evade selection through irregular means. He had not proven that others in similar positions were treated differently or that persons on the list had managed to get their names erased from it. The court did note that there was a large discrepancy between the number of men and women on the list but this difference had been reduced drastically in recent years indicating the authority’s intention at amending the situation. This discrepancy however did not automatically mean that it was due to discrimination as there might be a multitude of reasons why this occurred. The lower court had therefore rejected the defendant’s claims which he then appealed in front of the constitutional court. The defendant reiterated the claims, saying that the Convention dealt with all forms of discrimination as long as it involved the application of any fundamental right. The Court of Appeal noted that before the amendment a few years prior, female citizens were exempt from jury selection and participated only if they requested to do so. Since then, this legal provision had been changed and there remained no distinction between sexes, meaning that the law allowed for no discrimination. In practice, the jurors in the criminal court were then chosen at random, recused by the defence or exempted by the court. There are various reasons for the present discrepancy in the number of female jurors vis-à-vis male ones, including prejudice or cultural barriers; reasons which however could not be considered as caused by discriminatory practices by the State. Only time and education would allow for a change in mentality to occur. If anything, it is the accused who has the right to protest the selection process, for example by alleging that a jury skewed too heavily towards men which would jeopardize the fairness of procedures, and certainly not to another member of the jury. The court did however concede that the system utilized seemed to create situations whereby whoever was on the list tended to remain on it for a long period of time, if not until they died, without there being rotation of all the eligible citizens. The appellant was justified in his claim that a few thousand inhabitants were carrying a burden that ought to be shared between two hundred thousand and more, with persons finding themselves on the list being disadvantaged in respect to all the others who were not. The court said that the fact that the Convention allowed for forced or compulsory work in situations of normal civil obligations, such as jury duty, did not mean that the State could impose this type of service in a discriminatory manner. The court however concluded that the appellant had not suffered any particular injustice for being selected for jury duty on three occasions in the span of seventeen years. He had no right to decide by himself that he would not be taking part in further sessions or that he ought not to pay the fine imposed for his behaviour. He did have every right to protest his selection in court and even appeal an eventual decision. The court decided that the fine imposed was legitimate. The court therefore rejected the appeal but recommended the relevant authorities to review the juror selection process in order for the burden to be more equally distributed across the entire population.

The couple had married nineteen years earlier and had two children. The plaintiff claimed that it was a marriage of convenience for she had only married him in order to leave her family home and the responsibilities she had. In fact her mother had abandoned the family and left for Australia, leaving the defendant from a young age with the duty to care for her father and younger siblings. He added to have felt obliged to marry the defendant because he felt pity for her and because he had been dating her for a number of years, against the better judgement of his parents. The plaintiff also accused the defendant of keeping certain important information about her hidden from him, which had he been aware of beforehand he would not have contracted marriage. Moreover, the defendant before marriage had insisted that they get married and raise any children they might have in the Pentecostal faith. She explained that Pentecostalism differed to Catholicism on a number of issues. They did not believe in Mary’s virginity, that Jesus was the only son of God, the infallibility of the Pope, or in the Eucharist. She had seemingly succeeding in converting the plaintiff to this Christian denomination but then, upon his great insistence, she had agreed to marry by Catholic rite in order to please his mother who was suffering from an advanced stage of cancer and died a few months later. The couple obtained a personal separation after fifteen years of marriage. The plaintiff’s father confirmed that the marriage ceremony had only served as show for onlookers. The court started by saying that the parties seem to have entered marriage for the wrong reasons. The defendant wanted to escape the responsibilities at her home and the plaintiff to please his dying mother. This seemed to be a recurring grievance throughout their marriage which in itself was quite a miserable affair. Their consent had been vitiated because they did not even believe in the religion and the rites of marriage of the denomination chosen to celebrate their nuptials. They did not believe in the concept of marriage as understood by the religion, or in the essential elements of the same marriage, the latter of which the plaintiffs not only ignored but excluded entirely even before marriage occurred. Even though the parties had been dating for a number of years, there was never any serious preparation for marriage. Their relationship had always been for them of secondary importance and there never seemed to be any affection or love between them, as confirmed by the plaintiff’s adulterous relationships. The court had a word of criticism for the parties who during proceedings had produced voluminous witness accounts intended to reduce the worth and respect towards the other party, which made it clear that they never had the least consideration for each other. The plaintiff had wished to continue living the life of a bachelor, without any commitments towards his wife, while the defendant did not even believe in the rites celebrated during marriage, thus rendering the marriage an artificial one from the very start. The court therefore acceded to the plaintiff request and declared the marriage null, with court expenses borne by the plaintiff.",Maltese,

The plaintiff explained that upon receiving Maltese citizenship he had sought to register his birth and marriage certificates with Maltese authorities. However, the authentic translation of his birth certificate issued by the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, The General People’s Committee for Public Services, Tripoli Municipality Public Registry contained errors which were then transcribed in the Maltese records. The plaintiff noted that on his birth certificate he had been indicated by his first and third name as his name and surname, when in actual fact he should have also had a second name and a surname. Similarly his father’s and mother’s name had been translated incorrectly. Other errors were also found in the plaintiff’s marriage certificate in which apart from his, his father’s and mother’s names were also incorrect. On his child’s birth certificate, the plaintiff’s name was also erroneously indicated. In order for the amendments to occur the plaintiff presented the court with a new authentic translation of his Apostille Certificate which included the details found on his Libyan birth certificate. The Director of Public Registry said the details had been inputted into the Maltese registry word for word according to the translations of the relevant official documents provided by the plaintiff. The subsequent details on his marriage certificate were taken from the same translated birth certificate and therefore no error had been committed by the defendant. He said that he had no objection for any errors to be corrected as long as it was successfully proven that the changes were merited. The court started by noting that although registration occurred by means of official translations, this did not necessary mean that they were accurate. The court said that it was encountering numerous cases of errors in the translation from Arabic to English in documents issued by Libyan authorities. It asked about the idea that Maltese departments employ official translators of their own who could verify the accurate translation of official documents. This would avoid situations such as the one at hand in which requests for corrections of certificates of civil status occur years after the person first resided, worked, married and had children in the country, all under incorrect names and surnames. The court appointed an expert in the translation from Arabic to English who after reviewing the plaintiff birth certificate concluded that the names were as indicated by the plaintiff. The court therefore acceded to the plaintiff’s request to correct his civil document details by ordering them to be replaced by the translations provided by the court-appointed expert.

The couple had married eight years earlier, however their marriage had lasted for half of that period. The couple came from different religions and cultures which led them to be very indecisive on numerous considerations regarding marriage. In fact, the parties had problems to decide which religion they were going to raise their children since the plaintiff was Muslim while the defendant Catholic. The court noted that it appeared that the plaintiff had verbally promised the defendant that if they were to have children they would be raised in accordance to the Catholic faith and it was this that allowed the couple to celebrate a civil marriage. It was however evidently clear to the court that the parties nonetheless did not trust each other on this matter, so much so that both admitted to have taken precautions during their sexual relations for no child to be conceived. They did this to ensure that they would not have to face the problem they had on how they intended to go about raising their children. They separated after a few years. They excluded a priori the procreation of offspring from the relationship and the defendant, who promised one thing but without truly meaning it, essentially excluded children from the marriage. On the other hand, the defendant forced the plaintiff to accept her conditions, while still conscious of the fact that at the end of the day he would still not have accepted to raise the children in the religion of her choice. Therefore, even then the defendant made a deliberate decision not to have children from this relationship. The court noted that procreation was one of the essential elements of marriage meaning that both parties had simulated their consent to marry since they had excluded from the start, and at the moment of consent, their acceptance to have children, thus positively excluding one of the essential elements of marriage and therefore excluding marriage itself. The court therefore accepted the plaintiff’s request by declaring the marriage null, with court expenses divided between the parties.",Maltese,

The couple had married twelve years earlier after a one-year courtship. The plaintiff, underage at the time, had fallen pregnant and was pressured into marriage by her parents who had failed at securing an abortion for her. The parents, who the plaintiff described as being very strict, had taken the news of their daughter’s pregnancy very negatively and on first reaction ordered her to drink a 1.5 litre bottle of gin which made her pass out for three days but did not succeed in terminating the pregnancy. Afterwards her parents sought the advice of a doctor who gave witness during proceedings and explained that the parents had asked him if they were still in time to send the plaintiff abroad to secure an abortion. When the doctor informed them that it was too late for that to happen, the parents, adamant for their daughter not to give birth out of wedlock, ordered the young couple to get married as soon as possible. The plaintiff’s parents even refused an offer by members of the local Catholic church to send her to give birth in Malta’s sister island of Gozo where she would have been away from any watchful gaze. Marriage occurred within two weeks, with the parties excluded from most of the marriage preparations. The plaintiff did not even choose her wedding dress and said that on the day she had not been ready for marriage, feeling that they were being hurried by undue pressure from her parents and the situation they found themselves in. This version of events was mostly confirmed by both parties, with the defendant who admitted that at the time he had been under the influence of amphetamine drugs which the doctor described as a character-changing drug. At the time he was also abusing from anabolic steroids which even at a low dosage made him very nervous, causing him to have severe mood swings between anger and depression. He claimed to have been very unhappy and made daily unreasonable tantrums. Instability of character was confirmed by the doctor. He had words of praise for his wife, describing her as a wonderful mother and tender to the home but he could never get himself to love her even though she made her utmost to attract his attention. Instead, the defendant admitted to have taken every opportunity to be unfaithful and at one point converted to Islam and went to live with a Tunisian woman. It was a very troubled period in which he had run-ins with the police and even attempted suicide. The court noted that the plaintiff had been subject to moral violence by her parents and, had it not been for their insistence, the marriage would not have occurred. They decided for her by not allowing their daughter to marry freely but instead excluded her from every element of choice. On the other hand, the court said that the defendant at the time was not in complete control of his mental capacity which should have allowed him to evaluate and measure the rights and duties brought about by marriage so much so that he was never capable of fulfilling his responsibilities. He married the plaintiff solely because she had fallen pregnant and certainly had a lack of discretion of judgement on married life and on its essential elements. Problems were further exacerbated by a serious phycological anomaly induced by drug-intake which rendered him incapable of understanding and observing these essential elements. The court therefore acceded to the plaintiff request by declaring the marriage null, with court expenses divided equally between the parties.",Maltese,
MT193,2020.07.20,49/12 JD,,,Qorti tal-Appell,Malta,https://ecourts.gov.mt/onlineservices/Judgements/Details?JudgementId=0&CaseJudgementId=122500,American law; social benefits; welfare; patria potesta; parent; compensation,contracts and obligations law,"The defendant appealed a sentence given by the lower court declaring that she was to pay her daughter the sum of €10,756. The case stemmed from the daughter’s claim that her mother had received the sum of $34,947 in social benefits from the Social Security Administration of the United States of America which she had been bound to use and administer in the interest of the then minor plaintiff. The sum had been given after the plaintiff’s father had suffered a work-related injury while working in the US; an injury which precluded him from holding further employment. All of the man’s three children qualified for these benefits which were sent to their mother since the children were minors, even though the plaintiff had not been raised by her mother but by her aunt. The plaintiff asked the defendant to provide a report of how the sum was utilized, while requesting the court to order the defendant to refund the sum in its entirety. The defendant rebutted that her daughter’s claims were legally and factually baseless meaning she owed her nothing. The relationship between parents and offspring was regulated by Maltese law, in particular the Civil Code which stipulated maintenance obligations and patria potesta. And thus American law did not regulate the relationship between the parents and their children. Although the plaintiff at the age of ten had ended up living with her aunt, the defendant claimed that she and her late husband had continued to send regular financial support in the form of money and gold and had even opened a bank account in their daughter’s name which balance had been withdrawn by the daughter when she reached adult age. In addition, the defendant claimed that a prescriptive five-year limit applied, rendering the plaintiff’s request futile. The lower court took note of the legal opinion of an American expert presented by the plaintiff who said that a child’s benefit was paid by the Social Security Administration to parent as a representative payee for child, with the parent who must either spend the funds on the child’s current maintenance needs or save the benefits in an interest-bearing bank account that reflected that the funds belonged to the child. The court said that the defendant had provided further documentation which agreed with this fact. The documents received from the American Social Security clearly stated that the defendant was receiving payment for the plaintiff. The defendant had also been presented with documents to sign in which the American authorities asked a number of questions to ensure that the funds were being used on the plaintiff or otherwise safely deposited for future use. The lower court therefore accepted the plaintiff’s claim that the defendant had been duty-bound to administer the money for the plaintiff. It revalued the total amount to $31,770 in order to reflect $3,147 in expenses the plaintiff’s biological parents had incurred. The court noted that bank statements clearly contradicted the plaintiff’s claims that the defendant had never sent her any funds, which the court rounded up to €17,000 in order to make up for the transfer of any funds which could not be traced. The lower court therefore ordered the defendant to refund her daughter the remaining sum of $12,311 (€10,756). Court expenses of first instance were to be borne two-thirds by the defendant and one-third by the plaintiff. The defendant took to the Court of Appeal claiming that the lower court did not have the jurisdiction to decide upon the case as that was the exclusive competence of the American courts since the case revolved around American internal and domestic law. In this regard the defendant presented the legal opinion of an American lawyer in which he argued that social security benefits were an issue pursuant to US laws and subject only to US laws and interpretation by US courts. Whether those benefits were rightly or wrongly distributed was a decision which the defendant claimed should have been made by a US and not Maltese court. The plaintiff contested the entry of new evidence at appeal stage and the Court of Appeal agreed with the plaintiff as the legal letter was dated antecedent to the lower court’s closing of all evidence and therefore could not be considered as new evidence that would render it admissible. Regardless, the court noted that the letter failed to support the appellant’s argument as the issue did not revolve around the distribution of the benefits but of the way she administered them once in her possession. The plaintiff’s protestation were not against the American Social Security but against her appellant mother who kept the funds to herself instead of using them to raise her and pass on the remaining balance when the plaintiff came of age. The Court of Appeal said that the Maltese courts had jurisdiction to hear and decide upon all cases which involved Maltese citizens as long as they had not established themselves somewhere else. It was not contested that the appellant was a Maltese citizen, while she had failed to prove that her primary residence was not Malta. It also rejected the appellant’s claim that the court should have appointed an independent expert and not based itself on the opinion of the American lawyer presented by the plaintiff. The Maltese court had not interpreted any American law but had simply taken as fact the legal opinion with had not been refuted by the defendant. Equally important was the declaration made by the appellant herself to the American authorities in which she bound herself to continue receiving the funds in her daughter’s name. This was the issue which interested the court and not the American law which stipulated how funds should be distributed. The was plaintiff deserving of monetary compensation once it was established that the appellant had indeed received the funds as a representative for her child; especially when taking note of the fact that she had been raised by her aunt and not by her biological mother. In light of this, the Court of Appeal agreed with the sum calculated by the lower court which had also taken into consideration the payments made by the plaintiff. The court therefore rejected the appeal and ordered the appellant to bear all court expenses.",Maltese,
